installing the game was a struggle because of games for windows live bugs).some championship races and cars can only be unlocked by buying them as an addon to the game i paid nearly 30 dollars when the game was new i do n't like the idea that i have to keep paying to keep playing i noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to dirt 2.i tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game i 'm really tired of arcade style rally racing games anyway i'll continue to get my fix from richard burns rally and you should to http://www.amazon.com/richard-burns-rally-pc/dp/b000c97156/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&qid;=1341886844&sr;=8-1&keywords;=richard+burns+rallythank you for reading my review if you enjoyed it be sure to rate it as helpful
if you like rally cars get this game you will have fun it is more oriented to 34;european market&#34 since here in america there is n't a huge rally fan party music it is very european and even the voices from the game very 34;english&#34 accent the multiplayer is n't the best but it works just ok
1st shipment received a book instead of the game.2nd shipment got a fake one game arrived with a wrong key inside on sealed box i got in contact with codemasters and send them pictures of the dvd and the content they said nothing they can do its a fake dvd.returned it good bye
i got this version instead of the ps3 version which turned out to be a mistake console versions of games look 95 percent as good as their pc versions but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows first off the installation takes about 30 minutes which is ridiculous i have never had a game take this long to load shift 2 took about 20 minutes which seemed too long also next many of the latest games for pc are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games shift 2 unleashed is also like this so be forewarned internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes the game pushes you but does not require you to sign up for a games for windows live account which is required to get the game patches and updates more time wasted signing up for that finally after about one hour the game was up and running but the menu screen text had red blocky borders and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red with red reflections on the car and everywhere so more time spent googling to find a solution to this i had to download a hot fix driver update for my amd videocard driver which solved that red text and sun problem finally after nearly 2 hours i was able to play the game which is perhaps the prettiest racing game i have ever played magnificent graphics and fun excellent gameplay good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel and excellent sense of speed and immersion makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to it i was really finally enjoying the game when suddenly about 30 minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed no error message or anything it just hung up and crashed to desktop under windows 7 i later tried it with windows xp on the same machine and it crashed less frequently usually only when exiting the game but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game since it might not crash during an entire 20 lap race or it might crash on the 2nd lap it is a great game when it works and if you are lucky enough to have a machine that it runs stably on then by all means get this game but hang on to your receipt just in case i am tired of fiddling with my computer trying to find a totally reliable setup for this game so i think i am going to buy a copy for my ps3 which has never crashed in over 3 years of game playing i have been buying the top notch pc versions of videogames and spent thousands of dollars over the years on faster videocards and cpu 's but i have finally grown tired of fiddling with incompatibilities of hardware and software and now game publishers demanding that you have an internet connection as well as providing a long serial number utilizing gigabytes of harddrive space 30 minute or longer installation times it takes less time to install windows 7 and requiring you to sign up for their online service and game store and still you have to put that stupid little dvd in your computer everytime you want to play a simple game to relax i am pretty much done with pc gaming since the consoles are so much less hassle and they have good enough graphics that the diminishing returns of costly higher resolution better antialiased higher framerate graphics is not worth it when the ps4 and xbox 720 come out i think the law of diminishing returns will be even more evident
i had dirt 2 on xbox 360 and it was an okay game i started playing games on my laptop and bought a few new games to build my collection this game is very fun to play it is so much better than dirt 2 if you like racing games you should check this out the graphics are perfect on my compter
overall this is a well done racing game with very good graphics for its time period my family has has enjoyed playing it a great deal i personally think a steering wheel controller is almost a necessity for this game but an x box type controller would probably work the keyboard would be almost impossible and not very fun the windows live system detracts greatly since you must log in and be online to play or save game progress there was a mees up with my live log in and the game would no longer accept my activation code and i had to rebuy the game if i wanted to play there is no customer support at all dirt 2 suffers from this serious flaw as well 4 1/2 star game 1 star windows live feature
loved playing dirt 2 and i thought the graphics were good   purchased dirt 3 as an addition to the other ... and the graphics are absolutely gorgeous   if you liked dirt or dirt 2 ... you are going to love dirt 3   the game was easier to configure with my logitech wireless rumblepad ... and with my evga gtx 580 and all detail set to full on graphics at 1920 x 1080 i get over 100 fps   the game looks good plays well and is a blast
i ca n't tell you what a piece of dog this game is like everything else microsoft makes- it does n't work when are they going to take a cue from apple and make things that actually work the first time and every time to log onto this game they make you jump through a series of hoops that takes like 15 min to accomplish if you want another disappointment from microsoft buy some games for windows live games   i just wanted a simple arcade like driving game when i have a young boy visiting if that 's what you want do n't buy this if you want to hire a consultant to help you run this game then buy it   oh one more thing every time i do get this game to play my joystick stops working there 's windows 7 for you
i initially gave this one star because it was crashing on me constantly but i recently narrowed it down to a plug in i was using for my porsche wheel game plays well and looks gorgeous when image spanned across three monitors i would have given it five stars if it was n't for the annoying microsoft games for live application that makes you go through hoops to set it up and causes problems of it 's own occasional crashes
i still have n't figured this one out did everything as instructed but the game never installed strange since i do n't like to rate on something i could n't get to work i 'll just say that i did n't like it because i could n't get it to work :p for those that did manage to get it installed i 'm sure it 's a great game i had the first dirt and it was a scream too bad this one bombed maybe a bad disc ...
i 'm not quite finished with the game 's dirt tour mode but i believe i 've experienced the bulk of what the game has to offer   and i 'm happy to say that the game is indeed awesome   great cars great tracks and racing modes excellent gameplay and graphics   the highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in aspen   there are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement which are new to the series at first i felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike dirt 2 had where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty then lose big time on medium   then i found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options   basically you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you   love this feature   sadly there is no option to increase the 360 controller 's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity   i 'm doing ok as is but some tweaking would be ideal much like the previous two games the handling is a bit flighty   but that 's speeding on loose ground for you   still i feel things have tightened up somewhat since dirt 2   still no cigar but it 's a step forward   the game runs as smooth as silk on my 560ti wih all the settings maxed   no issues whatsoever   if you enjoy racing games this is not one you should ignore   it 's the best dirt so far
i have been playing car racing games since their early beginning on pc i currently have a logitech g25 force feedback wheel to play with i have played most of the colin mc rae need for speed grid and dirt2 games before i also tried my hands at more simulation oriented games like gtr gtr2 gp legends ... dirt2 came in as a nice and pleasant surprise dirt3 tops it off as i am sure many will detail everything about this game i will limit myself to the most important points for me pros:- amazing graphics- amazing physics- challenging but entertaining racescons:- gymkhana- interfacewhat went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck i saw the videos of ken block on youtube and indeed he is really impressive am i even dreaming of doing the same no!racing require good racing skills to start but gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level so i find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating now what about the interface simply put it does not remotely compare with dirt2 's interface it is messy i had to search online to figure out where to find my best times there are not enough info about the cars the races the sponsors ... it leaves a lot to desire a complete miss conclusion as far as rallye racing this game is the best out there today if you are one who needs crazy challenges try the gymkhana and good luck!in spite of my criticism i definitely do not regreat this purchase
dirt 3 on dvdi collect racing games so had to add this to my collectionson wated one also
i bought this and the key did n't work   it was a gift and the recipient was n't able to solve the problem   it might have been a good game but i never found out because the key failed
crashed in vista   codemasters told me they do n't support it in windows 8   could n't get it to work even after looking on the internet
this game was a rip off   it has less terrain less tracks and less features than dirt 2   the graphics are about the same   not worth the money at all
in today 's game market it 's easy to miss racing games that are n't part of the license heavy forza or gran turismo franchises dirt 3 for pc is in an even worse boat than most since it 's been a giveaway for a couple years now with every dx11 compliant ati video card as a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to ebay and most people who do play it have not bought it new this is a shame because dirt 3 is a fun little game there 's a great assortment of multinational tracks and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from as a rally game dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy fun arcade style game play but under the hood it calls for quick reactions a good understanding of road surfaces and nerves of steel sadly it also calls for a gamepad or wheel- you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all or nothing for serious racing pros:-visually stunning engine that makes full use of directx 11 effects soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely european and not too intrusive successfully models an arcade like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling in car camera gives a stomach churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and 2-wheel hairpins probably the most realistic depiction of drifting powersliding to appear in a video game it 's frightening nauseating and usually a bad idea)-3d support!cons:-lower difficulties are n't much fun highest difficulty is brutally hard small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers dirt 3 players seem pretty nice though)-essentially requires some sort of analog input may confuse players who are n't familiar with the rules and conditions of rally style racingother thoughts:-you need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to youtube i do n't think codemasters wants to rip you off but if it makes you uncomfortable create a new google identity for use with dirt 3 easy!-learn the tracks learn the tracks learn the tracks learn the tracks.-if you want to win employ a fin
this really is a step up from dirt 2 better graphics cars seem a little more responsive overall it was worth almost the money but of course i wait till the games are old hat and buy them cheaper the really bad thing is having to buy tracks and cars nope i 'm never going to do that and i think it is a crappy deal but that 's life if i had known about the lack of tracks and cars i would have passed there 's no real reason to finish the game as it 's just more of the same without paying a bunch of money to get all the extras that should have been in the game to begin with
this game is bug landfirst had problems installing because it required some windows market software then it did not have any voice sounds then it was running on windowed mode only now everytime i end a track it just crashes the computer bsod).i give up codemasters next time do nt rush a game out just because you have to test the game if not for yourself for colin himself if he was alive he would be embarrassed and do n't buy the game using steam because if it does not work steam will show you the finger :)
dirt 2 was like this   i 'm becoming more more suspicious of games like this that require a continuous open internet to play   it just seems like bait set out for some young naive prey to fall for   does anyone honestly believe that personal information is collected for no particular reason   i do n't care what they say publicly   any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight and nobody 's looking   it 's quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you 're being tracked but this type of continuous spying is something more   that aside this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security cons requires open internet windows live to play   annoying interface   continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do   most settings do n't keep between sessions   setting up a race takes way too long   irritating music you ca n't turn off it keeps coming back   takes too long to unlock things   entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating i just wanted out   video stuttering possibly my equipment).pros eye candy   plenty of game modes   enough tracks to get going   fairly good variety of cars   scaled difficulty levels from casual to advanced i think this franchise like many others continues soley for the purpose of farming user information where it seems the real money is   if i ca n't turn it off and some else controls the on off switch that 's a problem   sometimes it might be worth it but not here   i found some entertainment value but very briefly   anyway   just my opinion ...
lot of people do n't like rally because they already tried gran turismo game to tell you the truth gran turismo rally physic is just boring boring boring gran turismo only good for racing simulation but rally part is suck   dirt 2 amazed me how much fun it was and now dirt 3 with 3 time more race tracks than dirt 2   must buy
i would like give this game 4 or 5 stars if i could get it to run like others the game crashes on start up or in the game and codemasters has been absolutely no help in correcting it why they ca n't get their asses in gear pun intended and fix it i do n't know but with so many folks reporting the problem it is n't just occasional i assume they either ca n't replicate the problem or just do n't care lacking any help from codemasters i 've tried the various fan fixes including uninstalling rapture 3d. also tried installing on vista and win 7 and that did n't help either which is a shame since from the other reviews it seems like a great racing sim
the game itself is great but games for windows live is such a frustrating piece of garbage   i wish it would just die and stop bringing down my pc gaming experience
this is a pretty fun game but you have to buy most of the cars and tracks from the online store the game claims to provide so much more content however the scam is that you do n't get that content with the game you need to buy it if you win races you will get a message saying yay you can now purchase your new car from the online store!!!"omg really i can spend more money on a game i already paid for no wai!!!!but overall if you do n't mind playing with the same default cars all the time it 's a pretty fun game i really only play online mode which allows you to race against other people the computer on this game is way to easy so single player is n't any fun you could drive backwords and still beat the computer
this is a must have for any gamer codemasters really hit a home run on this one i would like to see f1 2011 be this good using the ego engine 2.0 and the physics model in this game is right on the money this game is the reason everyone should buy the best graphics card they can afford i am using a nvidia 460 overclocked and i have on order a 590 i want to run this game with everything on highest level i swear to you that even with the 460 the graphics are very realistic and i really enjoy racing at ground level this game makes codemasters the king of graphics realism buy this game december 6 2011   i saw my review of the internet and wanted to update it for you first of all anyone with this program buy the extra environments and cars it is money well spent and a first class job of an addon i wanted everyone to know that this program is still the top of the heap in graphics i bought battlefield 3 and it is good but not the standard of the ego 2 engine codemasters are the king of graphics so far and i find that the more realism a game has the more adicted you will become no other program running with all variables to the max looks like dirt 3 thank god for codemasters and i can hardly wait for grid 2 in the summer
works good however is not like a new with a little not important defect in appearance!really good and works fantastic
i bought this microphone to further enhance my rock band experience   i was not disappointed   it kept in tune well which was a problem i saw with other microphones and was light enough to not be a burden of any kind   i do n't mind that it is not wireless since i would n't move around much anyways   also the fact that it does n't have buttons did n't bother me mainly because i do n't mind using a controller to navigate   i do think it could have been packaged better but i do n't fault the microphone for it   overall a very simplistic yet functional design that works well
i love it use it all the time really works perfectly with all games that you need a mic for
works great!another cool thing even if a song does n't have harmony parts for more than one singer you can still do fake harmony as all mics plugged in remain active   however the back up singers will not be rated and will actually mess with the lead as the game does n't differentiate what mic is being used for lead unless there actually is a harmony part   meaning if you 're just singing to party you can use all three mics on any song and they 'll all just be treated as lead   pretty cool when you have a room full of mic hogs around the house like we do   lol   it 's just like when people would gang up all on one mic during a song but now they actually feel like rock stars having their own mics   for this reason we just always keep all three mics plugged in and anyone can just pick one up and join in   just do n't expect a good score ;-)
my grandkids and their parents love playing with the microphone along with the guitar we got.this really is a lot of fun for everyone   would totally recommend getting this if someone has an interest in music singing ...
i can not get this thing to work with my wii rockband 3.it might be related to the usb hub that i 'm using but it simply refuses to be detected by the game cosmetically it 's a microphone bit on the ugly side i would be wary of compatibility issues with this one
we bought this item for our wii it does not work at all for it :-( so that was a disapointment we did decide to keep it though because it works wonderfully on our x box 360
great game i love the storyline and graphics as well as the fighting style minus the super long time it takes traveling the ocean this game is a blast and a must have for any fan of the zelda franchise
i played the original zelda as a boy   i 've enjoyed a lot of good times playing this updated version with my 10 yr old son   great adventures and game play and luckily we can find tips for problems we confront on the internet   very well designed game that is user friendly   awesome
the greatest bait and switch betrayal of a fanbase in videogaming history and most hated game of all time to begin i will provide amazon 's customer base the 34;tale of the turd&#34 as i call it in relation to this abomination 's 34;quality&#34 or rather lackthereof gameplay utterly challengeless a lobotomy patient a two year old drooling baby in a feces filled diaper or even an individual with a severe case of down syndrome could easily complete this game in a single sitting with minimal effort just mash buttons or 34;spam&#34 the controls as pc gamers would say and you 'll eventually complete this atrocious slap in the face disney level aonuma dreck graphics hideous vomit inducing ridiculous teletubbies esque bait and switch from what we were originally promised at spaceworld 2000 realistic style epic cool and beautiful graphics with a decidedly lord of the rings style flare also there are ugly and gaudy white lines that appear all throughout wand wacker indicating nintendo was not able to polish this turd before release oh what a shame sound the only redeemable inspiring thing about this aonuma dud is the ocean music likely composed by koji kondo the rest is detestable saturday morning cartoon level kiddy drivel soccer moms and grandparents should approve real zelda fans can only vomit at this level of disrespect nintendo has stooped to in order to insult us theme near total rip off of kevin costner 's water world to such a great extent i fully believe costner could probably win a lawsuit against nintendo for royalties if he so desired needless to say this watery environment is not what true zelda fans look forward to when we go to pick up a new zelda game no what we 're looking for is the green forests and fields of hyrule proper not some watery grave that sits atop it for reasons likely relating to aonuma 's child learning how to bathe for the first time and aonuma getting inspired to make zelda into a giant bathing simulator via wand wacker i 've said it before and i 'll say it again nintendo needs to fire eiji aonuma and his entire zelda team and get normal people developing the zelda series again for it to return to health commentary the online game journalists also known as professional liars can attempt to re write history all they like but the legend of celda wand wacker will go down as the most hated videogame of all time and the greatest betrayal of a fanbase in gaming history this was nintendo miyamoto and eiji aonuma 's vince mcmahon esque 34;screw you!&#34 to the true zelda fanbase and by true zelda fanbase i 'm not referring to the scumbag sycophants that populate online gaming message forums but the market in general who determines whether videogames become massive successes or massive failures and the true zelda fans spoke loud and clear not once but twice two whole times on that wand wacker piece of dog excrement first with its original gamecube release and second with its wii u hd re release that this is not the way that they envisioned the legend of zelda series this is not the way they wanted it to go and as a result wand wacker flopped mightily both times as such a benedict arnold or rosenbergs esque betrayal is destined to do to rephrase a quote from ridley scott 's gladiator 34;marcus aurelius had a dream that was zelda and this is not it this is not it!&#34;we were lied to and led to believe that the epic cool badass spaceworld 2000 realistically presented zelda would be what we would soon be getting on the gamecube but then much later the bait and switch hideously deformed celda wand wacker made its debut to boos and hisses worldwide and massive hate on the internet was poured it and nintendo 's way before the damage control brainwashing took effect which has left a dishonest internet forum gaming community in its wake who pretends to love wand wacker in order to shill and run damage control for nintendo while real zelda fans have abandoned nintendo due to its betrayal of them for the other consoles or pc gaming if they have n't simply upped and left gaming in disgusting over this nasty unnecessary debacle and betrayal of zelda 's true fans eiji aonuma the hack no talent jimmy fallon of japan enabled by the out of touch shigeru miyamoto has been ruining the zelda series since he took up its reigns to create the embarrassment known as majora 's mask aonuma 's first game 34;marvelous&#34 failed marvelously and he had no credentials at all to be given the zelda series but insanely nintendo gave it to him and ever since he 's been driving zelda along with it 's sales figures into the ground making one boring puzzle filled bad npc filled faux zelda game after another when the truth of the matter is zelda is supposed to be an arcade action adventure sword and sorcery game with light rpg elements thrown in for good measure aonuma completely butchers this formula in favor of the boring garbage gameplay elements he prefers and the market lets him know what it thinks of his efforts by making sure his version of zelda ends up in the bomba discount gaming bins where such low quality trash belongs in anycase to re iterate so as to set this very important point in stone once more wand wacker offers up literally no gameplay challenge whatsoever and can be completed by a lobotomy patient as is typical of aonuma offerings).conclusion my rating of this turd is 1 star since i ca n't give it lower due to how amazon 's system is set up
lookin for a rpg this is the game for you filled with many hours of gameplay to find all the hidden items casual gameplay unless you try to collect everything then it 's hardcore good controls and challenging puzzels give this game its rateing
ocarina was almost beyond word but this is a cruising powerful and fun rival the worst thing about it is the seemingly endless confusing ocean i do not look forward to trying to finger out witch island i have to go to in which order as i think there is an order but i ignore all that for now and just enjoy the wonderful game cruising blue waters mystery dungeons ... and i still enjoy exploring the islands
are 9 out of 10 gamecube games like this little kid 's game terrible answer yesi bought the game and i regret it so much
so it 's definitely original and true to formula but there are a few aspects about this game that just do n't make sense to me the cell shaded graphics take some getting used to but i like them my biggest complaint is that sometimes i 'd be sailing somewhere and could leave make a sandwich eat that sandwich and come back and still not be at my destination also not including the side objectives it 's a relatively short game is it better no is it a zelda worthy of the title yeah i recommend at least playing it before making judgments or assumptions
my oldest grandson loves this game i can remember playing it when i was young and it was good back then but even better now
while the product is what it is described as it unfortunately will give me no signal whatsoever i believe it is a fault of the a v cable side as plugging that in unplugging it blowing on it hissing at it calling it names then plugging it back in seems to make it work again i did check and have the problem across more than one tv so it 's not the tv 's fault i have no way to determine with confidence if it is a fault of the wii but i doubt so as the wii has no problem with its standard definition cabling that it came with why wii did you not include component hdmi cabling by default hd is n't that rare ah but it is the most inexpensive version of this cable i could find and the picture is markedly better using this than the original cabling
this product is very good and works fine buy it if you want it it lets your we display in hd format of 480p which looks alittle better than normal av cable it comes with to the untrained eye you might not even notice the diffrence
this was exactly what was needed and has worked flawlessly since being received i recommend it if you need one
i was very disappointed in this item   we thought we would get a better picture than the standard wii video cables but definatley took a leap in the wrong direction   i would not recommend
i got this to hook up me will to my 72inc h d tv it set it up to 1080i not 1080p but besides that it 's a grate cable
the movers packed my wii cables in a separate box so i could n't find them i ordered this as it would be quicker and i was n't disappointed it is inexpensive and it works i did have my wii setup manual so it was no problem to get up and running right away sometimes you get what you pay for and sometimes it is better
i enjoyed the first hawx game however they left out some key things in hawx 21 no coop mode i really enjoyed that2 ca n't choose your own plane right off the bat you have to use whatever they tell you those two things will make me not play this game anymore
i loved the first hawx pc game when it came out playing hawx 2 got boring after several missions is just a shame
mild spoilers&lt;&lt;&lt;let me first off say that i was a huge fan of the first hawx installment and an overall huge fan of anything clancy i was eager to get this game because i had seen some great in game footage of the ac-130 mission and landings were now included before i start telling you why this game is a disappointment let me tell you what is good about it.1 the graphics are just as good if not better than the first hawx the detail of the maps are great and give you an almost there feel the planes seem better as well the plane graphics seem more realistic with a more war worn look that 's not as clean as before.2 it 's more realistic even though you still have a ton of missiles available it seems the designers spent more time making it tougher to hit the target.3 the a.i. is a lot more difficult gone are the days of sending out 4 missiles at a time every map at every threat i only remember one map where multi target was available and that was for ground targets.4 new technology you not only get to control an ac-130 but there are drones and precision guided bombs that expand the gameplay now for the not so good parts of the game i really like tough games they are a challenge and make for more fun but this game almost made me snap the disc in half here 's why.1 your wingmen are absolute garbage they do n't seem to do anything other than warn you of incoming missiles as if the red warning lights picture in picture and warning buzzers were n't enough.2 you will spent 90 of your time dodging missiles and 10 of your time trying to have a decent dog fight the mig-29 's are great they are extremely tough to get a lock on but as soon as you get any where close to missile lock you have to break off in order to escape incoming missiles.3 the missions are scripted you ca n't pick which targets to engage like you could in the first hawx if you are trying to protect a ground base from tanks you 'll be forced to break off and take out incoming fighters when you attempt to kill the fighters the ground forces practically destroy the base once you get rid of the fighters and try to take on the ground forces again you are taken to a cut scene or the mission ends that 's what really gets me the enemy does n't retreat if you overwhelm them like the first its just over.4 the storyline is boring rebel forces take over some russian nukes wow that has n't been done to death thankfully you can skip the load screens after about thirty seconds.5 this is n't that big of a deal but the game is pretty sexist there is a female pilot who talks quite a bit throughout the campaign and she is pretty much the only source of a team feel when she talks she is almost instantly told to be quite by one of your wingmen in the end she sacrifices herself trying to take out an enemy target and the game is like alright she 's dead who 's up next?".6 no choices of what planes or missile packages you get to fight with you are given some really bad planes to take into combat and do n't expect to play with to many us aircraft the game is set as a world conflict so you only get to play the f-22 and warthog in a couple missions otherwise your russian french or english the first game was great it had creative and fun missions like protecting the president of the united states and taking on wave after wave of ground targets this game is intense but i would say its not very fun there seems to have been a complete lack of imagination on this one i have only played the multiplayer a few times and it seems to be a rank up as you go system so maybe that is worth the price of the game all i can say is the campaign is a huge let down all feedback is appreciated thanks and good gaming
this is a nice little arcade game with good graphics and some good chatter it 's fun to play with after spending time with dcs blackshark   it 's a good shootem up enjoyable
anyone who has ever played a flight sim can tell this is not like a10-warthog just by reading the info on the game this is an arcade type game with some sim stuff add to make it sell more and be kind of fun and fast to play sometimes we all just want to blow the blank out of things and unwind this is fairly well made and the graphics are ok for what it is(a game).if you want a real flight sim this is not it if you just want to get online and have some fun with others for a while this is it the target aircraft can do hard right and left turns that would take the wings of any aircraft and that s not right but this is a game and not a sim this was made sometime ago and graphics have come along way but it is ok for it 's time you will not have any issues installing this or running this game on most systems with a gtx460 or better you can max out all setting with one evga gtx560ti 2 gb video card the install dose take some time to get done and it will update for you when you run the sim the first time this all takes 30min or so counting the install of the game it is what it is and that s a game not a flight sim but it is fun to play a few hours now and then i have a solid system and have had no issues running this at all if you are looking for a real flight sim that has ture reallistic flight of the aircraft and working cockpits this is not for you try a10-warthog or wings over europe or wings over vietnam or il-2.these are flight sims and run well on any solid sysetm with xp or windows 7 running
there are at least 5 missions that can not be completed without joining the forum then the creator 's forum and a lot of research downloading etc   4 of these defective missions were built by bottman" ... someone that should definitely find another occupation but ... do not waste your time because the missions are incredibly boring and far from challenging   the ones they label as hard are as easy as those labeled easy   my 6-year granddaughter could do most of them after 15 minutes of instruction do not buy this product   the gfx are circa 2003 the user interface far from intuitive and the support abysmal it 's a waste of money time too bad   ship.sim 2006 was actually better .... and all the missions worked   vstep took one giant step backward
the most amazing graphics you could see if you own a flight simulator yoke and/or throttle quadrent you can make your gaming experice easier the crash effects may not show in trailers or videos but in the actual game you can see the damage i higly recomend to purchase this product happy sailing to reader this is not a little little kids game it is comclacated
my father is a seaman i have seen many ships sailed with him around the world numerous times so ships are in my blood when i saw this game i bought it without batting an eyelid well i wish i did n't because i now regret my decision the game is unique in its concept we never really had a maritime ship simulation that was n't centrally focused on war and sinking other ships :) this one happens to be just peace time shipping simulation with different kinds of detailed ships ranging from cargo to passenger to rescues to towing to even trying to alter history by succesfully sailing titanic to new york on its first maiden voyage etc the game creator has gone to great details to simulate as much as possible the intricacies of piloting as well as managing huge ships operations any aspiring sea captian or sea salt will identify with some if not most aspects of piloting a ship as simulated in this game but to me that s where all the goodies end the cons associated with game are just too game breaking to me and i have essentially stopped playing the game until these issues gets addressed i am not spending anymore money on this games series first and foremost this game badly needs a voluntary time compression feature not all of us have 2 3 hours to devote each time we decide to play this game to have some fun sometimes it take an hour or so just to get out of harbour and tag some hours more on this to complete the mission with a game in which you are looking at ocean waves for hours this gets boring really fast this is just plain very annoying and game destroying factor to me i know some people have all the time in the world to savour and enjoy games but a lot do nt too since its not a action oriented game the passage of time is felt even more if they can incorporate a time compression feature it will make the game lot more open to different segments of gamers second is the still dated graphics engine i see lots of people commenting on how good the graphics look i have a pretty good rig and i can play games like mass effect and silent hunter 4 in almost thearatical quality but even with everything maxed out this game just looks medicore graphics wise the ships and ocean etc looks very simplistically rendered from today 's standard the graphical quality of this game released in 2008 is kind of dissappointing though last some of the missions in the game are just plain novice or fillers in my opinion this game is geared towards people who like to pilot huge ships yet we have a lot of missions devoted to speed boats for stunts hover boats etc i bought the game to simulate a ship expirience not go around flipping in speed boats anyways .. i would n't really recommend anyone spend 40 bucks on this game wait until it gets to 19 or so bargain bin and i hope the developers put some real effort into make a more viable ship simluator for its next incarnation or you are not getting any more money from me
i love this simulator it is a lot of fun controlling ships and boats i only wish the color was better because all the water is usually grey but other than that you will have a great time if you love ships
this game is a good way on getting at the helm of the rms titanic and i am very well satisfied with it i do hope that any of you who does decied ot buy it will also enjoy it
i still have my silicone protective case and it has n't let me down a single time very durable high quality and has n't rip at all
nice cheap made cover it does nt fot very tight but it does the job if you want to extend the life of your controller this is it
covers the controller more then others and is pretty durable great grip to it as well and keeps its color looks solid
its looks awesome but the down side is that it kinda slides when playing with the controller but still like it
nice skin for xbox controllers makes them more slip free and smooth softer too good deal and nice stuff try one
i 'm revising my earlier review i had only rated my transaction 3 stars previously due to shipping problems after the seller contacted me to do what they could to help with the problem i have to reconsider they contacted me promptly and went above and beyond in their effort to make me happy thank you this was the second case i 've purchased and would recommend it to anyone thanks again
i 've bought these before   they slip right on and unless you get one with an obvious defect they should last for years   these are a must have if you are afraid of your kids messing up your controllers   then again maybe they should get their own lol
this silicone cover has a very nice feel to it do n't use this with dirty hands dirt will stick to it this is a ok product for your 360 controller
put on my controllers so it would like not get wear and tear and they are great buy them amazing
my brother had one of these for the longest time so i used his until he wanted it back   i found this a lil while ago and have been loving it ever since giving the controller much needed grip and makes holding it for long gaming sessions much more comfortable
easy install and feels great the skin fits really well and functions properly i did have to trim up around the triggers because they moved around while i used them but after that it was perfect
my son loves it he says it makes it more comfortable and easier on his hands for those marathon black ops 2 sessions
as soon as i slipped this on my controller i knew that i 'd never take it off   it makes the controller much more comfortable in your hands and does not slip if you play for a long time and tend to get sweaty fingers
have had this skin for almost 2 months and so far there are no signs of wear or tear which is good its sticky just enough to be grippy but not overly so it protects the controller fairly well keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods the only problem i have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since i plan on cutting it off anyways plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart will update my review if it does nt last long
this is not the first one of these i have had in fact this is about my 8th there are many different skin types and different skin makers so you have to judge each on it 's own merit my controller skin arrived today well ahead of expected delivery just as described solid black and silicone fit is just perfect and installation had no problems good comfortable smooth texture while still providing a much better grip than on the hard slick controller plastic i like to clean my game equipent regularly and i always clean even new items before using this is a great way to test the quality of the item i cleaned the skin using isopropanal alchohol no gumming like you get with lower grade skins)and no color bleed onto the rag this tells me it is definitly silicone not some rubber stuff once on the controller grip is good comfort is good feel is natural i am very pleased with this controller skin i have been needing to get one for my extra controller i will definitly be ordering a few more later a friend has a birthday coming up
great protection and grip for a while but like a latex glove it stretches out after a little time   for the price a great deal
not the greatest but gets the job done for the price i can not complain it is pretty delicate but it is rubber what do you expect/
i really like this skin it makes the controller nicer to play with and looks nice as well yes i would recommend this to a friend
considering its just a rubber cover for the xbox 360 controller actually it 's made well ... and the price -- not bad at all excellent product for an excellent controller
unlike others on this site these fit very good and the material is durable which is of utmost importance to me   i 'm glad i found this item
advertised as more durable then they appear in person .. but they are tight fitting and completely more protection .. then say .. nothing and they do look more style ish then plain ..
put this on my controller no hand cramps after 7 hours of all night gaming if you want to make the controller a little bigger and easier to hold this is what you want
it works perfectly nothing is wrong with it
not sure what you can really write about this item it works fine ... i use it on the wii to play gamecube games and it works great and fast but the gamecube was always much faster than ps2 anyway ...
bought this for an old   gamecube i recently won in an auction   seems to work just fine purchased a few more since it works and the price is right
works great with my game cube i have n't tried it with a wii but by the description it should work there too
just right works great i ll be ordering again laters hope you will still be there then see you
this is a great and cheap memory card it is what it is ..... it is compatible for wii and gamecube its 64 mb 1019 block memory if you need one but it great product
works great   cheap price and way more memory than on the nintendo make   really great for you retro fans out there
works perfectly for the game cube i purchased came very quickly and i would buy this again when i need to
one of the largest memory cards for the gamecube it works great and loads fast no need for formatting at all
my lady dug out her kids old gamecube and games and started playing her old favorite harvest moon titles she quickly discovered the memory card was n't there anymore when she could n't save her games so in search i went i was surprised to find these were still available and not too expensive this one does the trick has room for quite a few saves she is happy so i am happy
this thing was doa it was n't even worth returning for the money i spent on it do n't waste your money on this card
this allows me to preserve whatever precious space i have left on my console for other stuff i may purchase another one in the near future
i bought this because i recently bought a gamecube for old times sake this memory card works great and was one of the cheaper cards
well atleast one of them worked what else could you want for the price the other one works too just not all the time
these things work really great and can be combined for even longer cable lengths but be warned that the rubber shielding seems to slip around the plug head not a big deal but could lead to eventual short
the product was just as the picture and works fine   it is long enough to play comfortably at a distance   there is no delay in control using this product
my nephew wanted an older gamecube game to play in our wii once i purchased the game for him we found out that the wii controllers wo n't work with the gamecube games when played in the wii after doing a little research i realized we needed the classic gamecube controller and a gamecube memory card once we got both of those the gamecube game that we bought finally worked after playing the game for a bit while being 34;tethered&#34 to the wii system because of the cable for the controller we decided we needed extension cables to have a bit more freedom so we got these controller extension cables he is happy
and now i can sit back far enough to see my entire tv and avoid wielders burn in my retina   so simple yet so obvious a necessity given how freaken short the big 34;n&#34 made their controller 's cords   buy them now and heal your spine
these are great if you have a wii and use your gamecube controllers these are a must have i can sit on the couch and not have to lean in towards the console and have the freedom to move around they 're perfect
i play brawl and melee all the time with my siblings and friends and sitting squished together 3 feet from the tv was a pain so i got these cables because it was cheep and could solve most of our problems with this even if it did not look like they would last long from some of the reviews but when i got these they worked great and did not seem cheap at all i expected there to be lag with the controls but there was n't they have survived a month of intense fighting and are still in top notch condition these are great if you need room or do not like sitting 3 feet from the screen
i bought these to extend the length of the game cube controller reach everyone that uses these has no issues with poor controller reaction times and can sit just about anywhere to play
works exactly as advertised bought these along with a 2-pack of controllers for the gamecube as my tv is a ways away from my couch and i wanted to play multi player with my wife the controller plugs into the extension cable about as snugly as the controller and the other end of the extension cable plugs into the gamecube which is to say plenty snug enough to keep it in while moving the controller and cable around semi violently but not snug enough to keep a controller attached after being thrown across the room just an example one major concern i did have when i bough these was the possibility of lag due to the signal from the controller having to travel farther this concern was unwarranted as i have noticed no difference in response time either way on durability i 've had these for almost 2 years and they have n't shown any noticeable signs of wear throw in a reasonable price 4 when i bought it from amermedia in 2012 and this is a heck of a deal for people that need a product like this i would recommend
they work fine but i feel like they have a little lag to the controls when i use it on my controller and out of the two one is already ripping they get the job done but i do nt think they will last very long
at 6 feet and at 4 dollars each its a good deal i ve seen some other cables for much more and these work just fine i like that they re black   and they connect into the controller with ease buy it with confidence
this cable extender worked great i used it when and had absolutely no problems with it at all it adds a good 6 ft of extra cable length i tried hooking two together and i found no extra input lag using these cables great if you need the extra cable
with the amount of interference i kept getting with the wireless controllers i was stuck far too close to the tv to enjoy many of the visual aspects of the classics this cable extension cord made playing some of my old gamecube games just as fun as the day it came out a big must have if you ca n't get the wireless format to work properly
i bought the 2 x wii gamecube gc extension cable cord   but after a few uses it started working wrong duplicating signalsif i press a in the controller the game detects a being pressed two times this is for all buttons   without the cord the error is no longer there
they 're awesome cables though   they work great and add those several feet you always seem to lack   now i can play my gamecube games on my wii from the couch   no batteries to change
i purchased these for my wii as nintendo no longer produces wavebird controllers by virtue of them being sued by a patent owner over the technology i did n't want to pay for a used wavebird on ebay so i bought some of these i sit back from my hdtv about 9 feet so i needed these for the wired gamecube controllers and they work very well even with mario kart wii there is some lag with the wavebird but there is no lag with these extension cables highly recommended
my living room is fairly large so these chords make it nice to play games which require the old controllers my family can play video games from the comfort of our couch rather than sitting on the hard floor close to the console
one of them broke immediately the other one still works i guess they 're just too cheap and there 's no telling if it will actually work longer than two days
i can now sit on the couch to play instead of putting a chair in front of the tv there are no problems
i have used these for months.out of no where no matter what happened it always looked like the joystick always was stuck going right no matter what game or what controller i used it always was going right the other one is fine though if you find one that is better quality definitely go with that one instead of these cool idea though ...
i bought 4 of these 1 of which was shipped to me with defects and 2 more became defective within about 2 weeks of normal use i would not recommend these to any one but could n't give a 1 star as1 of 4 cords still works fine
for people who still have a gamecube but do n't have a wireless controller do n't bother you 'll be disappointed because none of them come with the damn adapter these cords are fantastic i can take my controller all over the house with them if i please and they do n't cause lag or short out to any degree i can tell they 're not shoddily made and have lasted well so far i 'd buy them again
these awesome sauce things make any gc controller as far extended as a wavebird given these days any games i have time to play are all via the wii anyway having the extra length for gc controllers is great
i bought 2 sets of this product so 4 cables total i was not disappointed they all work perfectly and they accomplished what i bought them for i have 2 big screen tv 's and the 2 rooms i use for these have couches that sit back a lot further than the standard gamecube controller cord would reach hook 1 of these extensions up to each controller and problem solved i also like the length because i still had room to go back farther but this allowed each cord to rest on the ground so there is less of a tripping hazard for those people that never fail to walk in front of everyone and do n't pay attention to the cords they even work for bongos so that is a nice feature to be able to move the bongos back as well for those games
i always hated how gamecube controller 's cords were so ridiculously short since i use them on my wii now it is much more hazardous for my wii if someone trips over the short cables this was a perfect solution to my problems so far i have n't had any problems with them and they allow me and my friends to not sit 6 ft away from the wii another great thing about these is that you can plug them end on end to make a longer cable
this is n't a particularly deep product they are wire extenders to be used for the nintendo gamecube controllers they come in a pack of two which is fantastic for the cheap price they extend approximately 6 feet in length and with the already fairly long wire on the gamecube controller already these come in handy if you need to sit somewhat far away in a regular sized room i have had no trouble with these at all as they function properly and connection just as easily to any controller getting these beats paying the higher price for the wavebird wireless gamecube controllers i 'm on a budget so i 'll just stick with a wired controller no big deal
the gamecube controller wire is length has always been annoying once got these that solved that problem they work great fit right and do not cause any controller lag great buy
this really cam in handy we need a extra length for the controller and it was perfect exactly what we needed
these extenders work as expected i bought them when i wanted to buy double dash for the game cube to play on my wii if you 're used to playing the wii you probably sit much further away than a standard gc controller will reach so definitely pick some of these up
i bought this game way back and recently played it again .. well .. the game was easy to beat when i was 6 and its still as easy well my problem(s)?not enough characters and its just not very fun and .. yeah that makes it boring .. but if ur a fan of the older games like me you may like this game unlike me it 's cheap now so i guess it would n't hurt to pick it up .. it costs as much cash as to rent a game at the videostore .. so do what you want with it
this is eaiser than the first one but it 's pretty fun i liked it you get to play some original characters like bad mister frosty taffy the blob   bonker ickybodclay(my favorite).if you liked this game then check out clayfigter c2 judgement clay clay fighter extreme clayfighter 63 1/3 sculptor 's cut clay fighter tournament edition
let 's not mince words here clayfighter 63 1/3 is a poorly put together game the game had a lot of possibilities but everything lacks polish characters are missing frames of animation backgrounds look decent but unexceptional and the fighting engine lacks the strategy of street fighter the speed of killer instinct or the playability of mortal kombat in any normal world this would be a one star game except somewhere along the way clayfighter 63 1/3 is so bad that it actually becomes good character design is pretty good and the special moves and taunts are hilarious the game is playable not in any way that it can compete with the above mentioned games but it still makes you want to come back for another round if just to see all the things the characters can do there 's also a bit more value once you unlock the secret characters though it 's frustrating that there 's no save function that keeps these character unlocked certainly not worth full retail price but the n64 is dead now so you should be able to snag this game for dirt cheap also be on the lookout for the sculptor 's cut version this was a blockbuster only release but most were sold off as pre played games it contains a hilarious singing intro 4 new characters and other enhancements
why do so many people love to hate the clay fighter series okay even i 'll admit that the genesis installments were far from masterpieces but this one gets almost everything right i first read about this game in an old back issue of nintendo power from 1997 it mentioned numerous characters that eventually got the axe some like lady liberty and the zappa yow yow boys were remolded for the sculptor 's cut released to rental outlets another hobocop was gone for good however since i only had molasses fast dialup i was unaware of these facts when i saw it along with a nintendo 64 in a game store less than a year later i knew i had to have it as the first n64 game i ever owned it may not receive a totally objective evaluation but i 'll try my hardest to be fair the one thing that immediately jumps out at the player is the self mocking sense of humor the moment you see the p in the interplay logo fall apart into a c you know what you 're in for during fights the characters themselves spew out one liners and funny quips almost as much as they do punches while this gets repetitive after a while it still brings on a chuckle or two as one would expect the fighters are all made out of clay and animated via stop motion while a few namely ickybod clay are a little uninspired the rest are a joy to behold and all are animated smoothly with nary a hint of pixelation unfortunately the polygonal backgrounds while often funny in their own right do n't hold up nearly as well they range from decent to horribly angular the selection of characters is slightly limited at the start giving you nine clay combatants but three more can be unlocked numerous characters return from the previous outings including mainstays bad mr. frosty the blob and taffy ickybod clay and bonker return from the first game and hoppy from c2 judgement clay not making that up comes back as t hoppy the other fighters include kung pow houngan and interplay 's own earthworm jim the characters are balanced well for the most part and their moves are just as funny as the fighters themselves my favorite aspect of this game is the control the n64 's controller has its share of detractors who say it 's not ideal for fighting games they could n't be more wrong the six button scheme works in the same way as other one on one fighters but here each level of punch or kick weak medium and brutal has a noticeable difference the combos are also easy to grasp and easy to execute something that few fighting games as of late are able to get right the story as with most fighting games is so inconsequential as to be vestigial but it 's slightly humorous nonetheless basically dr. kiln who took control of the clay meteor in judgement clay is now trying to take over the world by spreading the clayified state to the whole planet and then he can somehow control it i dunno but you fight him as the last boss overall this game is certainly the best in the series anyone who likes fighting games at all should grab this as it 's certainly worth claying
i have been a fan of the whole of the clay fighter series and i have to say that i am slightly disappointed with this one   the graphics are okay there are plenty of characters to choose from but i think that it is far to easy and that the game had been rushed   the price is excellent and i recommend to everyone that you get this as the price of this game wo nt be around for long   if you want the best fighting game on the n64 then i would nt recommend this but if you want some fun then this is the game for you
have n't play for long time and love this game as enjoy play it good play game i guess well alright
this is the perfect rpg for beginners since it gives you the very basics of gameplay but nothing amazingly spectacular except for a few interesting   bits that will fuel your interest in the genre just be aware of the fact   that this game is rather dull my two reasons for not liking the plot is   that a there is no central villain and no villain at all for some three   quarters of the game so you basically get into combat for no reason at   all and b next to none of the six characters in your party exhibit   anything close to a personality unless you count the fairy style innocent   frolicking a personality well naturally a couple of minutes before the   final battle you are introduced to an actual villain quot;kill the   goddess kill the goddess!&quot but the personality or lack thereof   problem is never fixed also throughout the entre plot the writers seem   to be trying to tap into a wealth of nostalgia when there simply is n't one   this game has it all friends parting and meeting again runaway   princesses guilt ridden characters many year lapses characters willingly   dying in combat against you cameo appearances of characters from past bof   games and much much more the combat in the game is handled in the   standard rpg fashion turn based hit points magic points levels you   know the drill oh yes there is the famous quot;turn into dragons&quot   bit but there is no change in the interface you merely look different   and have different spells for the duration of combat i do not like the way   combat is handled graphically the characters simply square off against   the foes there is no special battle screen and swing into the empty space   until the foe is dead there are also a few annoying bits it takes eight   seconds to escape from combat during the eight seconds the characters   merely stand in place it takes equally as long to quit menus you travel   far too slowly etc etc etc.)the music is nothing overly   spectacular in fact i rarely even noticed it the graphics feature 2d   sprite characters on pale low detail 3d backdrops bu since you can rotate   them the illusion of the characters blending in is lost like i said   above this is a nice trial run of the genre nothing spectacular but   nothing horrid
so glad i ordered this game it was like nostalgia overload of awesome it helps that it was in perfect condition with the case and booklet and got here super fast one of the best rpgs i have ever played and just a heads up you totally can not beat the two unicorn bad guys in the beginning no matter what the internet tells you so do n't wast 20 hours trying to
with the genre monopolized by the the final fantasy series it is not suprising that this game is absent from most people 's top rpg list to clarify it is not as good as an ff game but it is nonetheless enjoyable and fun the story is pretty linear the characters are well developed and part iii offers much of the same fun that was the original bof for the snes which was produced by squaresoft not capcom the only drawback is the clunky controls which can be frustrating when you are trying to move down stairs or bend around tight corners and while the graphics are not on par with final fantasy ix or chrono cross this is still a great looking game try it i think you will like it
breath of fire iii 's old school graphics capture the feel of old rpgs and how good they were playing on nes and super nes back in the old days now   i still play snes playing such good games as super godzilla breath of   fire i and the final fantasy series the storyline goes as follows -- ryu is   a survivor of an ancient race of dragons the brood which nearly destroyed   the world however he is a good dragon he allies himself with yraall   region thieves rei and fellow dragon teepo who at the time does n't know   he 's a dragon he aligns himself with the young princess of wyndia   princess nina and the daughter of a smart scientist momo a mutated   vegetable named peco who has a lot of significance at the end of the game   and a guardian of urkan tapa who 's race once fought and defeated the   dragons in a war garr together they quest to find ryu 's origin and other   members of his race and to find out if ryu is evil or not with beautiful   music surroundings and a great storyline this is one of the best rpgs of   all -- with many mini games abound and a fantastic battle system definitely   get this if you 're a fan of capcom rpgs
breath of fire three is the third part to what was a very good series of rpgs breath of fire one seems to be what most people i talk to about games   consider the best even though i loved breath of fire 2 the most i   expected a lot from breath of fire 3 perhaps this helped lower my opinion   of breath of fire 3 but i did not like this game as far as game play   goes like all bof games in bof 3 you have the ability to turn into a   dragon like bof 1 and unlike bof2 when you turn into a dragon you stay one   for a while while you 're a dragon you loose mp every turn to keep you from   staying one forever in that combat unlike bof 1 all the character seem to   get their own special power the character list is short and one of the   characters on the list of the book never fights with you as a character   the training system you can find people to help you with is actually kind   of pointless weird and honestly i did n't like it the town to town walking   is slow and you never get fast transportation as far as plot goes the   plot is the plot starts off okay then about two hours in goes in a   different direction it is fine for a while then but around the end is a   large dungeon that is boring to go threw and leaves the any not very much   of a climax they lost any suspense you could have built up similar to the   tales of destiny ending also the characters do n't have very strong and   noticeable personalities also if you keep up with it you wo n't like the   direction the plot takes thirds of the way threw as far as control goes   it 's basically standard of with noting exceptionally notable about   it the graphics to this game are not very good it is done in sprites   sometimes i myself prefer sprits but i do not like the character drawings   of this game on the walking town to town map character looks chubby and   short the drawings are basic and too simple there was only one of the   dragons i liked the look of however there is a little onion that can   follow around with your party who beat all other rpgs in cuteness of a   single character the cute hopping onion is defiantly the main reason to   buy this game if you do and finally as far as length of time it can stay   interesting the game is longer them many rpgs wo n't be beaten on a short   rental if you get this game buy it overall this game is the worst of   the bof series i do n't recommend buying it unless its finishes some   collection you are working on or if you have to see a hopping onion follow   people around
basically breath of fire 4 stole a lot of ideas from it 's predecessor this one it 's kinda like a degraded breath of fire 4 actually but still truly brilliant and well worth buying
this is an excellent game that really has some substance the graphics are not the best and it is oversahdowed by the bigger game final fantasy vii if ff7 was too long for you get breath of fire 3 the story is good and the battle system is great
love the game thanks!this game is great from the look and the level of detail and the combat thanks
after defeating xenogears i was looking for a game that was fun to play and did n't require me to do much thinking xenogears was a monster game that had a fantastic yet confusing plot that really made you think breath of fire 3 is a complete change of pace instead of going for an engrossing and confusing plot like ff7 and xenogears breath of fire 3 continues a simple but fun plot that feels refreshing to play after finishing a monster game like xenogears breath of fire 3 does n't have an overly confusing story once long ago there was a clan on earth known as the dragon clan after gaining enough power to destroy the world the dragon clan suddenly disappeared you play as ryu a young boy who suffers from amnesia he soon befriends two thieves named rei and teepo after he gets into trouble with the authorities he soon finds out he is an ancestor of the dragon clan so he embarks on a journey to uncover his mysterious past sound original sorry but if it 's originality that you want you wo n't find it here even the battle system is painfully unoriginal as you play it it will feel like you have played something else exactly like it the story the battle system everything feels like it was used many times before and i hate to say this but the ending is very disappointing however with all gripes aside breath of fire 3 is a fun and engaging quest my favorite part of the game was the characters they are interesting and very funny i also liked that the plot never once got confusing even though it was unoriginal it never got off target and it even sometimes kept you on the edge of your seat with all the complaints aside breath of fire 3 is fun game to play through after playing through a monster game like xenogears it is refreshing to play unfortunately do n't get too excited about the ending
this game is one of my all time favorites i give it a 10/10 in the rpg genre   it is a turn based rpg that is fun to play   i own this game for the psp and the now the ps1   this game is a rare find in good condition   if you find a better rpg than this besides the final fantasy games of course let me know
breath of fire 3 is a traditional rpg with a combination of 3d and 2d graphics   the characters are what one would expect from a bof game the battle layout is well done for the most part even though the loading time for some commands is just horrible   the masters system is a cool idea as you can shape your characters into any class you want by apprenticing them to the right master   the feature that keeps bof 3 from reaching classic status is the story   it starts out interesting but about halfway through the game it seems to lose it 's purpose   another annoying aspect is the desert area near the end of the game the directions they give you are vague and confusing   worst of all however is after all the long hours you put into playing the game the ending is short and stale if you are a seasoned rpg fan and have played through all of the other rpgs for playstation bof 3 will keep you busy until the next big hit arrives   if you hate puzzles and long loading times however breath of fire 3 may not be your game
breath of fire iii is one of those games that can induce a trance of nostalgia upon thought   i can say this about few games because most are powered by processors that reflect obsession with graphics and innovation   innovation is necessary and appreciated but games like bof3 need never disappear   it caters to the old time gamer in all rpg veterens delivering a simplistic save the world storyline and involving gameplay   and what gameplay   it 's simplicity and charm will hopefully impress those who give it a chance because it is very deserving of credit   last i must mention the fishing system   it 's incredibly addictive simple and enjoyable   nothing else could more easily describe it   throw in about another hundred fish and a wider variety of rods and bait and you 'd have a full game that i would have to own   it 's that good   for everyone whether an rpg newbie or a hardcore veteren you should give this game a chance   fun does n't begin to describe it
this was the only breath of fire game i 've beaten   but i must say that it was fun   the story and side quests kept me going one of the downers was that you ca n't hardly change your angle a big thumbs up going to the fact that you do n't have to change screens to get into a battle like chrono trigger   this saves lots of time and makes thing more dramatic   fighting in narrow hallways and thick forests was great!i'm not going to spoil it for anyone ... but the ending sucked badly   but not enough to stop me from buying the next sequel   ^_^
breath of fire iii arrives almost three years after the fun but strictly orthodox super nes title breath of fire ii although bofiii is n't a radical departure from the earlier games in the series do n't let that turn you off it 's reassuring to see that sprite graphics have n't given way entirely to origami style polygons sporting a quasi medieval european setting a heroic story line and turn based battles bofiii will appeal to fans of square 's final fantasy series and working designs lunar titles an epic journey breath of fire iii starts with the discovery of a tiny dragon that goes on a deadly rampage before it 's captured the dragon escapes and is transformed into a young boy named ryu who is befriended by a pair of delinquents whose thoughtless pranks get them captured by some truly evil people ryu is left for dead but his dragon powers revive him so he sets off in pursuit of his friends captors unaware that he 's about to be drawn into an ever deepening pool of danger deceit and death like earlier bof titles ryu can befriend several partners during his epic journey nina the princess of windia makes another appearance in the series although in this game she 's apparently unrelated to her earlier incarnations ryu too shares the name of a character from the series but he 's also unrelated however gobi from the first bof game makes a cameo appearance nostalgic graphics graphically bofiii is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors texture mapped polygons are used to create the backgrounds terrain and buildings while sprites are used to compose the various characters more animation colors and special effects have been added to this version but the look of the game will still be familiar to fans of the bof games the three quarter overhead view field map can be rotated somewhat so you can peek behind obstacles but not to any great extent battles are fought directly on the field map with characters and monsters displayed diagonally in one of four directions two are seen from the front and two from the rear solid craftsmanship the battle system is turn based with some consideration given to quickness characters move in sequence to their speed parameter for example in some battles you may want to use light armor so that your character moves quicker instead of heavy armor which can slow you down also certain characters have speed parameters higher than their enemies and may get extra turns while fighting beyond the usual manual magic and item attacks characters can transform into dragons initially only ryu has the power to transform and only when he 's far into the game but the other characters gain that power later transformation though requires crystals called dragon genes and ap magic points for the genes chosen by combining up to three genes different dragons can be created the more genes you use the more powerful your dragon though you 'll use more ap ap is also consumed at a constant pace while the dragon is in battle finally you can learn monster skills for special attacks and spells the construction of breath of fire iii 's battle system and of the whole game for that matter is very polished thanks to excellent controls you wo n't be moaning about the way this game handles sound bites however all is n't well in bofiii the sound effects are fine if not particularly inspired in battle the characters emit rudimentary shouts screams and spell names but not much more and even though the sounds can get annoying they 're not anywhere near as badly done as the soundtrack the music veers widely from unmemorable electronica to hopeless schmaltz and more often than not it does n't add to the atmosphere of the story the music seems more appropriate for a corporate infomercial than a heroic fantasy rpg aside from the inexplicably bad soundtrack bofiii is worth a long look from rpg fans although it does n't possess the visual and aural magnificence of final fantasy vii which few games will ever accomplish breath of fire iii holds up as a very enjoyable rpg in which sure craftsmanship is easily evident
many may disregard the breath of fire series as just another rpg but capcom has done a beutiful job with this title   they pulled out a lot on this case   beutiful 2d graphics that only capcom can do good music simple controls make this an excellent purchase   chances are you may find this at a good price somewhere so i say go for it
quot;breath of fire 3&quot is a very interesting and well made game   the plot is pretty good and the characters are interesting and memorable   one thing i do miss from the older quot;breath of fire&quot is the way they transformed into dragons the process in the current game is excellent i just prefer the older methods   my favorite part of the game is that you start off playing a young version of the character and then later in the game you get to play a more mature version of the same character   this game is a lot of fun and suitable for most people who enjoy the genre
yeah the cpu is like   completley retarded gulie does not counter with his flip kicks ryu does nt ever do his shukoken uppercuts to counter but   some of the characters can be pretty hard like t. hawk but i just do nt get the street fighter arcade like feeling
street fighter is perhaps the definitive fighting game series should you feel it necessary to buy absolutely every individual cartridge disc of the six games contained on the two sf collections then do so and spend a ton of cash they are all excellent titles but the two collections of a game that defined the fighting genre are perfect street fighter collection the original that is in the spotlight is actually the more up to date one while it does not contain the original street fighter ii it does contain 3 classic street fighter games first is super street fighter ii the new challengers released on snes and genesis in 1994 it was mindbendingly good the first time i played it it had a solid 16 fighters all 8 from street fighter ii the bosses plus 4 new characters never heard of before cammy dee jay fei long and t. hawk you might think oh wow a new edition with new fighters never seen that before well you 're wrong super street fighter ii did contain 4 new arenas respectively the ones for the new fighters it also had newly mixed music newly animated profile shots and newly animated backgrounds basically it was a perfect upgrade super street fighter ii turbo is also included it may seem like super street fighter ii with the speed like street fighter ii turbo but it added something each character had one super move from ryu and ken 's shinkuu hadoken to chun li 's kikousho they really gave a great new edge to the series akuma is even hidden in this upgrade also the definitive of the three street fighter alpha games street fighter alpha 2 gets upgraded to street fighter alpha 2 gold edition cammy is added on and evil ryu becomes playable yay what 's strange is that some of the cast gets an additional playability in their sfii ce animation so it 's definetely worth picking this up ... if you do n't already have all three of these games for your snes alpha 2 is also on the ps
forgotten amidst the blood of mortal kombat and 3-d presentations of virtua fighter and tekken the street fighter ii series initiated the fighting game craze   whereas its successors won their fanbases with graphical geegaws street fighter ii 's strength was superb well balanced uncomplicated gameplay that was simple to learn but exhausting to master   street fighter collection accurately reproduces that gameplay making for an excellent anthology but not a flawless one firstly the omission of the first three iterations of street fighter ii is glaring   given the lack of complexity of those games one has to wonder if capcom 's developers were too lazy or their marketers too greedy to finish those titles for this release instead leaving them for street fighter collection ii   graphically the games are preserved admirably although cd audio forces the game to start each track over when speeding the tempo up unlike in the arcade games   the long load times are excruciating as is each title requiring its own memory card block when the high scores for both titles could easily fit into a single block the inclusion of street fighter alpha 2 gold is nice but seems out of place in what is supposedly a historical collection   perhaps the developers felt they rushed the original street fighter alpha 2 to market and tried to save face by placing the more polished gold version in this compilation   and since this third title requires its own memory card block street fighter collection actually requires three blocks in all not one as is advertised on the packaging still all three games have withstood the test of time and are worth purchasing for gameplay if not historical value   but the aforementioned drawbacks of the street fighter ii games and dubious packaging do detract from the compilation as a whole
the sheer number of games bearing some form of the name quot;street fighter ii&quot is staggering so when capcom announced that it was putting together a compilation of street fighter games i was stoked my excitement quickly cooled when i discovered the true nature of capcom 's package street fighter collection contains super street fighter 2 super street fighter 2 turbo and street fighter alpha 2 gold a slightly updated version of street fighter alpha 2 the original street fighter 2 champion edition and hyper fighting are nowhere to be found the result is a shallow package that should have been so much more the graphics and gameplay in the super games are almost identical to what you remember every frame of original animation appears intact and there is n't any noticeable slowdown however the graphics do appear a bit fuzzy the sound is decent and the music even speeds up and intensifies when a character is near death the second disc contains street fighter alpha 2 gold the game is almost entirely identical to street fighter alpha 2 with only a few differences first any character that was in street fighter 2 champion edition can switch between normal and champion edition modes playing a ce version of a character disables his super meter and changes a few moves here and there the ce character graphics are still alpha 2-style also there is now an akuma mode which pits your character against akuma over and over again instead of fighting all the other characters also cammy is hidden in the game she appears in her x men vs. street fighter costume all this is fine and good but what about all the other great street fighter games where 's sf2 turbo hyper fighting or the original sf2 complete with guile 's quot;handcuffs&quot and all the other weird little glitches capcom truly missed out on a great opportunity by releasing a quot;collection&quot that is obscenely incomplete if you 're really itching to play ssf2 or ssf2 t this package is right up your alley but fans hoping for a complete collection must keep on waiting
the one thing people are missing to consider about this game is that if you notice the collection is a collection indeed and a fine one at that but mostly shows how the street fighter series evolved   if you note that it goes from super street fighter ii to ssfii turbo to sf alpha 2 gold   well my point is that it shows in order how the series evolved to becoming more complex and technical with super combos added   1st it starts with super ii no supers at all just classic then goes to super ii turbo where the super combo made it 's debut and every body had only one super then goes to alpha 2 gold where it really shows what you can do with a super combo plus more characters and every body had atleast 2 super combos lets go over it:1st classic with no supers lots of characters2nd classic with supers making debut same amount of characters3rd advance from 2nd with more characters and 2 supers for eachnot only that but it 's a classic game mostly to me just an example of the evolution of the series if you are still looking for what you thought this game would be get the 2nd one otherwise it 's a wise decision to go with this one
finally after years of seeing mega man in 2d shooter side scroller gameplay capcom began to realize the video game scene was changing and realism was becoming more important than ever   so in 1997 capcom decided to take the classic gameplay of the old mega man games and bring mega man to an entire new 3d world   i finally got to experience the 3d mega man adventure a few days ago in july 2006   so it took me nine years to finally play it   what can i say   i 'm slow!i have a few problems with certain parts of the game but overall i 'm happy to report that the jump to 3d was a good one not to mention a necessary one   mega man spends the entire time in legends jumping and shooting through a unique 3d environment i'm surprised so many people hate the graphics in the game   they 're quite wonderful if you ask me   sure the graphics may be dated because the game is nearly 10 years old and walking around in mega man legends is sort of like walking around in a giant land of legos but none of that should matter because you have to take into account the amount of fun a game provides   mega man legends provides a lot of fun i really loved one of the very first boss fights in the game where i had to keep running and hiding behind buildings because these giant walking blue red and yellow machines were throwing bombs and shooting laser beams at me   the first time i completed this battle it took a good 30 minutes only for a bigger badder machine to come in and defeat me in seconds   at first i was angry because the game would n't let me save before fighting this fourth boss   a half hour of work flushed down the toilet was the thought that went through my head that led me to think the game might be too hard for me to handle but it turned out i just did n't have the right upgrades for my x buster equipped actually i did n't have anything equipped so when i went back to do the battle again i defeated him her actually rather easily most of the enemies throughout the game are rather easy to defeat including the boss fights   many of the boss fights will keep you on your toes though   the strategy to defeating many of them is to keep running and only turn around when the moment is right and blast them   the only boss who is n't easy is the very last boss who sounds like michael jackson because he has two forms   the first form you can figure out with practice but on the second form he turns into a giant machine and then the challenge increases   but it 's possible to find enough money to carry up to 10 sub tanks to help you out drastically   if you were to carry 10 sub tanks he would be a very easy boss   despite that the game provides a nice challenge because the way the story unfolds forces you to do a lot of things   you have to go here you have to go there   you have to collect this you have to collect that   you 'll find out just how many items and weapons are in the game when you hit the start button and see everything in your inventory   it 's borderline insane.you see to help make the game easier what you have to do is go around searching for things things located in treasure chests or holes in walls and then you have to bring the things you collect back to this yellow vehicle where your female friend or sister i forget who she is will be inside   she can find ways to turn many of the things you collect into important weapons for you to use   she must be smart!i think i explained myself correctly there   it 's kind of confusing because there 's so many things you have to collect and that 's the main reason i ca n't give the game a perfect 5-star rating   too much   in mega man legends you will find so many weapons and so many upgrades that it can easily confuse someone like me who 's normally not exposed to this much activity in a video game you have to find a little dancing monkey to save your game   when you 're lost he can also help you by telling you where to go unfortunately many times he does n't provide enough information   so you can be left wandering around for hours until you finally have no choice but to find a strategy guide on the internet to help you out the music in the game is nice   it 's usually played quietly which is odd because most mega man music is right in your face   if you can actually hear the music it 's pretty much what you 'd expect from a mega man game listen to those sound effects   sound familiar   think south park   one of the children or pirates sounds just like butters and a newswoman who appears later in the game sounds like kyle 's mom   some of the animation looks like south park too   when did south park come out   1997   hmmm makes you wonder ... once again the graphics   they are n't as bad as i thought they 'd be   sort of blocky of course since this is playstation one we 're talking about here but i ca n't bring myself to really hate the graphics because there 's a certain mysterious charm about them   mega man legends looks like a children 's game but it 's not really   most children would n't be able to complete the game because some boss strategies require careful timing and it would be difficult for a child the play control ... goodness   it 's definitely not easy to figure out at first   to make mega man walk straight you have to hold down the l and r buttons this rotates the direction mega man is facing while at the same time you have to use the up down left and right buttons to make mega man walk forward   so because you have to do a lot of running in mega man legends when an enemy is chasing you and right behind you you have to turn around use the l and r buttons to face him and then hit him   in the middle of hitting the l and r buttons will probably be the time you take the most hits   it may take a few hours to properly pull off but you should become better at it with practice a trick to help you when an enemy is chasing you run as far away from him as possible and then turn around   usually the enemy will be far enough away that you will have time to control mega man so he 's facing the enemy directly   then simply wait for the enemy to get close and fire away   i would n't blame you if you could n't figure out the controls- it 's not the greatest way to control a character   i 'm not sure if capcom improved the play control in mega man legends 2.i find it funny and insulting that when you find a hole in a wall many times a very small amount of money will be located there   small enough to not be able to afford anything   it 's funny because capcom made it like wow you found money only to insult you with sofa cushion money   to find a lot of money you have to run around shooting enemies just running around shooting enemies and collecting zenny money is a lot of fun not to mention addicting   a pretty good game worth picking up
looking anywhere else people will charge more than 80 for an old wonderful game like this classic games like these are hard to come by wish i had traded in less of my games when i was young
megaman legends is capcoms answer to bringing megaman into the 3d realm on the original playstation however this game is extremly diffrent then any other megaman game out there in fact it has a lot in common with zelda ocarina of time and a few rpg elements such as final fantasy while still somewhat feeling like a megaman game coming from the nes and snes megamans i never thought i would ever compare zelda and megaman together but surprisingly it works well its not the greatest   game or even the greatest megaman game ever but it is really fun in its own way most people do not like the graphics in this game but i think there done really well the only problem graghicly is due to the early psx hardware most 3d games looked blocky and pixely at the time and this on tries to smooth things out kinda cel shadish but not quite this leads to some blockeness but its still better then most 1998 and before graphics kinda a 3d playable anime style to it the sound is n't to bad in this game voice acting can be really good or painfully bad andthe music is catchy maybe not as much as the nes megamans but still good however there is moments without any music technically speaking i would say the game has aged well the thing i find most memorable about this game is the gameplay like i mentioned earlier this game takes megaman into zelda like enviorments with a few rpgs elements there is a open world which was decent in size for its time which the game takes place in a small town there are dungeons to explore which you do so in order to find upgrades to your equipment speaking of which you can purchase and find diffrent armor and weopens with diffrent specs attack fire rate etc in a rpg like menu with that being said it still manages to feel like a megaman game there is plenty of missions of which you are running and gunning while jumping on platforms the bosses while set up like zelda can be taken down easier by weopens you find around in dungeons as for the story it is n't to bad it is a little childish but its still pretty good the characters while the voice acting can be off at times can be good are very memorable tron bonne makes her debut here as a villian who became popular enough to get her own game misadventures of tron bonne and a apperance in marvel vs. capcom 2 and appearing without megaman in the 3rd there is also a n64 port of this game which is nt as good but if you do nt have a psx its still playable plus a sequel anyway while the hardcore 8bit megaman players may be turned off by this i would still recomend getting this game
this game was very good the first 3d megaman game to be released
i remember playing this when i was 12 the story was great and i played it through more times than i can remember
this was a very chanllenging game for me it took me about three months to beat the even old original 64 verison way back in mid 2000 i think it was when back when i was about and was midway through my final and last growth ssuppert i belive i later when i was about 14   got the newer playstation version i unfortunatley due to a couple years lack of experience had to use the invulerability and zeeny to comple in a lower completion time of about maybe 10 to 40 hours compared to the original   completer time of about maybe 30 to 80   hours maybe more or less this game will be fun once you get used to some changes one megaman like in the later   games of the original series was original drastically increased in size at a huge height of abou 4 to 6 six feet tall and abhout probaly weighs about   130 to maybe 350 pounds witrh his armor on this is the biggest mega man ever made   once you learn how to concort the stroneger boss with high atatck strenght and to dog them this may be a piece of cake   to beat jungo increas e every thing one the midssle launcher to max this will give you infinite ammo with this one the ammo update to unlimited if you pay up enough zeeny you cane beat juno easily just hold down the button the missle will shot of function like heat seakers as long as you have infinite health slash cantina points one you can sit there turning your missle into the ultimate automatic fire weapon pushbed the out fire down and   keep shooting them of at rapid speed even if you get hit you should be able to take this boss down and complety both parts of the battle in about maybe 45 second   20 minutes maybeless this   is a fun games i hope you enjopy it even though roll is now longer robotic and rusha and beta no longer exist if you like this and want a really challange to test your patience and enduranc eplay the insanly hard megaman legends 2 also avilable in playstation format
to me mega man legends is one of those games you 'll remember years after playing it the game itself does n't break any new ground and has its share of flaws but the overall experience is definitely rewarding mega man legends pretty much plays like the earlier tomb raider games control wise unfortunately there are a few problems with the control scheme such as a lock on system that does n't allow you to move while locked on an enemy which was fixed in mml2 and the fact you also must contend with moving the camera manually in order to compensate for the lack of a better lock on system to hit your mark legends also uses a pretty similar graphic engine as tomb raider as well complete with all the flat 2d scenery that rotates with the camera and all the pixilated surfaces and clipping problems that accompanied that era of playstation gaming unlike tomb raider the environments in mega man legends are much brighter and colorful adding to the games cartoon like feel rather than the dark dank death trap ridden tombs that lara croft raids the pretty low difficulty level of the game is also an important factor to look at as well considering this game is somewhat geared towards an younger audience this is n't an error so to speak but older more experienced players will fly through the game in a handful of hours especially considering most of the game bosses can be defeated by constantly circling around them and firing thankfully capcom added an unlockable difficulty setting to make the game harder for those looking for an additional challenge oh and is it ever a challenge add to this capcom increased the difficulty on mega man legends 2 a few notches and all can be forgiven here so with all these problems why is legends such a good game heart and lots of it mix in a good story a wonderful cast of characters and enemies and throw in some of capcom 's more respectable forays in voice acting department and you got a winner while some may claim that legends carries a kiddy tone i actually find this to be one of the game 's charms and strengths honestly if you do n't laugh when one of the lego men err i mean servebots messes up and angers tron there is something wrong seriously it is n't anymore kiddy than a mario or zelda game or most of nintendo 's gaming library for that matter).the other thing that makes the legends series so great is the fact capcom decided to quit while they were ahead while i myself still wish they would churn out a mega man legends 3 considering some of the unresolved issues in mega man legends 2 's ending at least capcom did n't make a zillion sequels and drain the series of all it 's fun and respectability of which they have done a fine job of doing to the original series and x series in the end mega man legends is not a game you 'll remember for amazing graphics razor sharp control or challenging quests instead you 'll walk away with a overall memorable experience
well as far as the person who sold this to me goes the game came as described and in a well timed manner and i would shop here again   however the game itself is just not as fun as i remembered
megaman legendsthis is my undisputed favorite game of all time i bought it in 1998 or so because i had played and lovedmega man 3for thenintendo nes system video game consolewhen i was young this game was nothing like that game or any other megaman games it was in 3-d and had a story that would blow your mind i have played through this game around 50 times and no every single part of it by heart graphics- 7/10the transition to 3-d for megaman is n't an ugly one but a decent one most of the trees have a 2-d look to them and a lot of characters are blocky still you can tell what everything is easily and there is no slowdown at all not to mention there is hardly any load time to wait through in this game story- 10/10you are megaman volnutt roll casket and her grandpa barrel casket have raised you since they found you when you were a child following barrel 's footsteps megaman and roll become diggers diggers are people who search through ruins infested with reaverbots to find parts and other things the main thing a lot of diggers are looking for are refractors which are extremely powerful crystal like objects that power society the world is almost entirely ocean so people must use flying machines or boats to get around megaman roll and barrel crash land their flying ship the flutter on an island called kattelox you go on to discover the island 's many secrets and fight off the treasure hungry pirates sound- 7/10the music and sound effects in this game are decent nothing will blow your mind away but nothing will annoy you to death some tunes even become catchy like the apple market tune gameplay- 10/10you play as megaman exploring ruins fighting pirates and just helping people out there are a lot of side quests you can do you can join a secret gang fill a museum with underground arts help a little girl recover play in game shows and so much more the main storyline has you exploring the sub gate ruins in hopes to learn more about the island 's great treasure or disaster while in sub gates you can find all kinds of items to do things with it 's not just in the sub gates either you can search in other digging sites for parts you have a primary weapon called a buster gun which can be upgraded with 2 buster parts initially these buster parts can be bought or found and change different aspects of your buster gun 's shooting you have a secondary special weapon that can be equipped and upgraded as well you will get many different special weapons in the game and one of the most fun parts of the game is upgraded your weapons to perfect ability difficulty- 4/10 note- this is how much i like the difficulty)since this game is more story based the difficulty is slight there is hardly a time where you feel that you are going to die minus a few bosses once you beat the original game you can go back and play it on a new hard mode option the game is still not that much more difficult but some of the bosses will give you more trouble also to top it off the game is n't that long even the player who likes to talk to every single person and gets lost often can still beat this game in less then 15 hours that includes the main storyline and all side quests minus special weapon upgrading i can now beat the game on hard mode in around 5 hours overall- 10/10despite the game being easy and not having the best graphics or sound it 's still 5 stars the game 's storyline and gameplay is so good that the rest does n't even matter you 'll still find yourself going back and playing this game over and over again
mega man legends is a great new series for mega man   the story takes him to an island searching for energy crystals on his dig adventures   game play is fun and easy to learn   the game has plenty of secret goodies for you too discovery adding hours of replay value   easy and fun to play but not easy enough that you 'll only spend oh ... one week or so one it   loads of fun a most have for hardcore mega man and new mega man fans of all ages
i will never forget the first time i played this game a friend of mine had been talking about it for months when i was finally able to borrow a playstation and rent a copy of this game it is really a fun action rpg with elements of mega man indiana jones and zelda
mega man legends revolutionized the blue boy wander forever mega 's 1st 3-d appearence i strongly suggest that you buy this game.$15 is an awesome price in the game mega man is looking for the quot;mother load&quot;,the greatest prize of quot;diggers&quot;.mega man also thinks that if they find it it might help solve the mystery about roll 's past in the game you can find air shoes(the famous x quot;dash&quot;)and the famous helmet you start with mega man having no helmet but thts cool you can also get special weapons like the sword and a drill i would say this and this only .... buy this game now
game works great amazing story that brings back childhood memories i love it awesome game to have that is old school
legends is one of the rare megaman releases that takes place in a 3d world as opposed to the traditional 2d side scroller most mm fans are familiar with both legends and legends 2 are among some of the best made story driven 3d adventure games the psx has in its massive and sometimes daunting library
i already own this game but it 's in terrible condition this is due to me lending it out which is something i certainly do n't do anymore my favorite megaman game period along with 2 i had to get it again and i have no regrets besides i have 2 copies of the game now one with only case and disc that have seen their better days and a newer complete copy that reminds me of my original copy in its prime
good game overall its fun and easy but rewarding the voice overs are so cheesy that its actually funny and enjoyable to listen too if you have not played this game yet and you enjoy mega man get this game
i personally like many types of fighting games and fun is the thing that keeps me coming back for more   a game can have pretty graphics sound great and have all the bells and whistles in the world and still play like ...   this game might not be as pretty as the saturn version but who wants a saturn one of the biggest flops since the future flop of sony 's ... ps3   a few frames missing and slowdown which i have not experienced personally are by no means reasons to dismiss a game that combines x men with streetfighter very well   one more thing to mention about the price   not to insult anyones intelligence but simply supply and demand it is discontinued there are fewer and fewer copies available thus causing those on the open market to raise in value
i actually played the saturn version with the 4 mb ram cart and i have to say that the ps1 version sucks why because tag team was taken out because the ps1 could not handle it it did not have enough ram random access memory to switch fighters since it takes about at least 40 mb of ram and the ps1 only has 32 mb   if capcom did put in tag team then it would take forever to load up a character once you tag team with it you can tag team with the same character but it does not feel the same i suggest get a saturn it is only 10 bucks or less get a 4 mb ram cart which you can find at eb.com or any video game store and get the import version of x men vs. street fighter trust me you wo nt be disappointed
x men vs street fighter was a big hit in the arcades everybody said that game was the s**t the saturn was the only home port that gave us tight controls great graphics good animation still had tag team mode unfortunately thanks to bernie stolar we in the us did n't get x men vs street fighter nor the 4 mb ram cart so those of could n't get the saturn version got this s**t on the playstation which is bad on 2d it did n't have tight controls it did n't have beautiful graphics animations were bad sluggish speed oh no tag team mode i remember renting this version thinking it was terrible it 's just this game was n't made for the playstation now the action replay that bypasses region coading uses a 1 mb 4 mb ram function i would also require a ascii saturn arcade stick for this game too so any owner of the sega saturn should get that version it 's a great fighting game that plays like the arcade
to say that the ps1 version of capcom 's x men vs street fighter is butchered is saying it lightly   what made the game so great in arcades was the tag team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight   this feature made for great fighting fun but because of the ps1 's ram inabilities that feature had to be omitted   it 's obvious capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the x men and street fighter licenses and while on it 's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag team feature the graphics are painfully watered down the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates and there is loads of slowdown   if you can get past all that this may be worth checking out if your a street fighter fan but the marvel vs capcom games that would be released later on next gen systems are more worth your time
i love ryu i love wolverine ryu invented the fire ball not goku goku who you could suuuuper juuump and throoow fire balls fire balls bring out your second character fire power
i wasent as inpressed with this game as i thought i would be   first of all the load times are forever   second   this game has cartoon graphics   theird   i hate the street fighters in this game forth i love the x men they are absolutly fabulus
when a system is incapable of doing justice to a game one would think a company would be smart enough to not release the game on that system but for reasons that are probably based entirely around making money capcom has released a completely butchered version of its arcade fighter x men vs. street fighter on the playstation the only thing added to the game is super cancels which allow you to string multiple super combos together super cancels were lifted out of street fighter ex without much forethought so some characters cancels work better than others in fact the entire game seems to have been designed without much forethought even if this were a perfect translation of the arcade game the simple fact remains that x men vs. street fighter is a terrible unbalanced pound on buttons at random and win anyway fighting game one of the few things the arcade version and the saturn version which was an arcade perfect translation had going for it was the graphics they were n't spectacular but the characters were large colorful and used a lot of frames of animation the playstation a fairly weak machine when it comes to 2d simply ca n't handle that much data so capcom chopped out tons of frames juggernaut does a whole lot of standing still and his attacks are about two frames the graphics look very washed out and there is a completely unacceptable amount of slowdown ken 's shinryuken super combo had most of the frames chopped out and it still slows the game down to a crawl the slowdown and missing frames are so bad and so noticeable that they have a detrimental effect on the already bad gameplay the arcade version 's big selling point was that you picked two characters and could tag team between the two at any time during the fight your teammate would also come out and help in a two level team attack as well as in alpha counter style attacks since duplicating this on the playstation would require keeping four entire sets of animations in memory the tag feature has been completely removed you still pick a second character cruelly taunting players expecting the full functionality of the arcade version but he only makes his presence felt during the team attacks and counters to make up for the shortened play time the one round battles of the arcade have been extended to the standard two out of three format characters also slowly regain life much like your backup character would in the arcade this game just should n't exist at some point in the development cycle someone should have stepped in seen that the playstation simply could n't do justice to the original game and pulled the plug it took an additional 4 mb of ram to get the saturn which already has more ram than the playstation to run a perfect version of the game i like the street fighter series as much as the next guy but this is taking it way too far
i spent a week trying to get a grasp of the controls for this game   i 'm a true batman fan and even i had to put this game down after several attempts   it was either too dark so you did n't know where the character was going or you could n't establish enough control of the game to fight the bad guys   not real crazy about the commute to the crime location as well it was hard to locate where you were going unless you are the true dark knight who knows every inch of gothem city   unfortunately the writers expected us to know as well
i bought it to complete my set of batman games for the ps1 i would recommend it to anyone who collects batman games
what do you mean quot;a big glitch&quot batman amp robin is a mere better than poor i 've looked in a quiz and two italian plumbers mario and luigi both relate to this game besides mediocre is 10 better than poor
yes i 'll review batman robin to the playstation and why could n't have been like batman forever arcade it 's wrose than batman forever on snes and genesis i do n't know which is wrose this game or the joel schumacer film becuse i do n't know what to do after i get the diamond i know what i 'm getting with the film a very bad one just leave them both alone
this game is complete crap the graphics look decent but the gameplay is for sh**.i ca n't even begin to tell you how bad batman robin is first off the controls are terrible you have a hell of a time trying to figure out how to fight drive the batmobile swim use the gadgets ... it 's even a pain to try and walk the map of gotham is very small and all of the buildings of the area look the same the game is also almost impossible you get one life after you die it 's game over and right back to the beginning you can also die quickly as well you can play as either batman robin or batgirl but their combat moves look absolutley retarded overall this is the worst batman game i have ever played batman forever on genesis was better then this dud and we all know how bad that game was i highly recommend that you do not buy this the only reason why you might wanna purchase this is because it 's a pretty rare game and it could be a part of your game collection but as far as the game itself goes .... it sucks
the playstation version of riven is definantly not as good as the pc version but it still adds up to be a great experience solid gameplay crips graphics and top notch sound but still falls short in some areas disc changing can get very tedious that 's one reason why i recommend the dvd version for the pc but it 's no doubt this game will suck you in and keep you sucked for a long time get ready to experience a whole new world
i ve played this game on my pc when i was really young i thought it was actually creepy which i kinda still do i just love the myst series and this is my favorite i got it for ps1 to play on my ps3 and its still that awesome game i remember it as the case i got it in was pretty broken but its just a case that can be replaced i really wish they still made games like this
i liked this game alot it 's challenging and it took me awhile to beat longer than most other games i do recommend buying the strategy guide because it 's easy to miss alot anyways if you like the original myst you 'll love this great graphics only flaws was there was a glitch here and there but nothing major
back in 1993 a little game called myst appeared everyone went crazy for   it -- it featured amazing graphics addicting search and explore gameplay   and it was actually educational a main part of the game was reading so it   figures that many parents were so supportive of it it was also though   terribly spooky at times you could be anywhere in the world of myst and   still feel a general sense of ... well spookiness but myst was in 1993   -- and even though it held well throughout several years which is   amazingly good it started to be noticed more as a classic than current   technology so how well can quot;riven the sequel to myst&quot hold up   against quot;current technology&quot and the original classic by simply   making the adventure more intresting more long and with more   quot;spookiness&quot -- an original myst cliche that adds drama to the   game.&quot;riven&quot is even more rewarding than quot;myst&quot so   much to the fact that it is sometimes speechless there 's five cds to the   game -- that 's clearly enough for anyone to buy this game even as it   starts out you better look for clues the developers made it so that if   you do not look for enough information you could go from one disc to   another in less than 20 minutes the graphics while nice are n't the   best in the world even the control using the playstation controller is   sometimes sticky but believe me you 'll get used to it it 's definetly   worth a buy from any fans of the quot;myst&quot era
except for having to switch discs all the time   i know it 's a fact that this game was so big you had to swap discs that 's the only reason i did n't give it a 5   other than that the game is completely immersive   it puts you right in the world of riven   this game inspired me to purchase myst   part i in the series   i hope that they make more of these games for the playstation 2 and 3 coming out   myst iii exile was the last game to be ported on the playstation 2   come on cyan put more out for the playstations
most teekns fans carer started with tekken 3   and if you were an aracde aholic it started with 2   had this been the easrly 90 's this gamewould have got 5 stars hands down   but over the years this game is aged   tekken 1 was not an arcade blokc buster and really came to age on ome systems   most fans of later tekkens will notice that this game was left for improvements   thee characters while perfect stunnning and apporpiate for the early 90 's are blocky and of little detail   although it was light years beyond virtua fighter 1   and the fact that this was one ofthe first 3-dgames without chessy ringouts and a highly detail and cue combo system   most fans of later tekken will notice the cheese factor of the gameplay   you could basically pumble the computer or an human oppeonent with little ease on the ground   which was improved in later tekkens   and the 8 characters which again was appropiate for the times   the story of this game goes back to early tekken   heatchi(sp was the final boss and was pretty hard due tothe fact you could be killed with only 3 moves   i do nt remember if devil kaazu(sp was a secret boss but he was selectable only through a very hard unlock process   anyway i know that the later tekkens blowthis game way but his is a classic   introdcuing oyung versions of tekken legends   law paul and kaazu(sp   this is a personal favorite of mines   but the reason for the low rating is the fact that the gameplay was cheesy   which again was greatly imporoved upon in later tekkens
while the game may be outdated and not as fun to play as some of the more recent titles i ca n't fault this game because this is where it all started on its own merit in 1995 it was a smash box hit and everybody was ahhed by the graphics 3d environments and the musical score back then we were used to super mario world and final fight this was something completely different no one cared about the flaws the game had back then it was par for the course now in 2012 a whole 17 years later really that long ago ... a person can easily recognize the flaws of gameplay sound and playability sound effects are lo fi almost like comparing a cassette to a cd the soundtrack is still amazing though as if it were mapped on an entirely different bit format playability there is one overall mode the 1p arcade mode unless you count options and 2p every successful completion of the game with a character unlocks a new character to choose the same one you fight in round 8 after that you have all of the characters and there 's not much else to do there 's no team battle no survival just ... 1p arcade so it works for 1995 the ending movies are pretty bad all having the same soundtrack and really blocky ugly cgi of course in retrospect this was 1995.the movies never got better in the series until much later but they did improve some overall tekken deserves a place in your psx collection right next to 2 and 3 you wo n't play it often because tekken 2 covers all of those bases and more so to me at least this game is merely a collection piece
the first time i played this game i was amazed by the sheer quality coming out of this game the grahics were absolutly incredible and the gameplay was out of this world this was all in 1995 now that tekken2 and tekken3 had arrived on the scene it seemed as though tekken had faded to a fairyland back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them and know that games like tekken2 tekken3 and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue all i know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken if tekken had never come out then i believe with a 100 that none of the existing games that i have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance despite these games being in existance tekken is still a soulfighter and is the game that made namco famous on the playstation
works well for me except i ca n't get my championships to show at the end i m not sure if that is a glitch or not
the graphics and gameplay are very out dated the movies at the end are stupid and only the first eight players have them the only reason i even got this game is because i loved tekken 2,3,tag and 4 the only reason i do n't sell this is i want to have all the tekkens but if you want to buy it do n't pay more than 2 for it
well i bought it because i wanted to collect all the tekken games(i did :d and it brings back alot of memories
ever since i was young i have been in love with the tekken series brings back a lot of good memories i bought this game to bring back the memories and the fun though the graphics are n't as top notch at games these days are but it 's still an entertaining game to play if you collect either tekken stuff or video games this is a must own
this game was great though it doesn't compare to its original arcade machine this home version is nice anyway the fights are all fun the graphics still look fantastic even though this game is nearly a decade old now and the characters are all good and the storylines are all interesting to unlock the bosses which is the main thing you have to beat them all with their already available counterparts the first time you beat heihachi which is the main boss for this game you get him unlocked but the rest of them you have to play as the counterparts to get their bosses even with the playstation 2 and x box and state of the art systems like that on the market many of the games they put out today can't compare to classic games like this this is one of the all time greatest fighting games ever and i dare say this might be the best of the tekken series even has great music
never actually owned the original tekken but i played it since i 'm the best tekken player in the universe i 've decided that i want to own the game that started it all ....
from the cool first cutcene to the classic music that plays while picking a character you know this is special don't just button mash learn the combos because this is the only game(out of 100)that has made me curs at the tv if you 're a beginner start of with someone with fast kicks like marchial law and not jack 2 buy this because it 's an absolute classic
i really like playing this game with my son he has so much fun with it
all i can say is that this game is a classic possibly the best game ever made for the playstation 1
i bought this because i enjoy fighting games but the controls are so hard if it used analog control it would be a lot easier but overall its an o.k game
well i just recently bought this game again after finding it broken from unkown causes quite a few years ago people keep on saying tekken 2 has horrible graphics and the gameplay is horrible to those people did you ever think that this game came out during the 90 's and was probably awesome graphics back then if you 're a fan of good fighting games i reccomend this it has lots of characters fair graphics and is a good collectible for your tekken collection
the cd worked for about 4 days and then ... bam it was skipping like crazy it froze wen i picked jack-2 or kunimitsu and now it wo nt come on at all it was a pretty crappy copy
ever since i was young i have been in love with the tekken series brings back a lot of good memories i bought this game to bring back the memories and the fun though the graphics are n't as top notch at games these days are but it 's still an entertaining game to play if you collect either tekken stuff or video games this is a must own this sequal is too good to miss out on buy it before it 's gone for good
this game was a very good game but this ain't as good as tekken 1 like its predecessor has great graphics great looking moves and great bosses to unlock which gives you a reason to wanna win the game with every character the music is great here too this is a definite gem get this and its predecessor for the ultimate gaming experience
though this review may be 14 years 2 late n my opinion tk2 is the best of the ps1 tekken games from the cool fmv intro 2 the ending credits tk2 is by far the best looking sounding 3d fighting game on the ps1 console tk3 backgrounds music fmv cinemas light source shading animations combos just does'nt measure 2 the standards set by this 1996 classic and it was release 2 years later go figure
i remember tekken 2 being one of my first fighting games i have ever played and one that i kept coming back to it was n't just the nostalgia that kept me coming back but the overall gameplay as well almost everything about this game was done right and there is very little to complain about tekken 2 takes place 2 years after the events of the first tekken the plot is n't very well developed and is n't really involving but everything else more than makes up for it the graphics for the time were amazing and the animations were also nicely done the roster includes 24 characters who are all unique and feel very well balanced the game is very accessible and almost anyone can pick up this game and get a pretty decent grasp on it the controls are simple and intuitive and i always believed that this control scheme each button controls a limb ex left punch right punch is one of the best for fighting games for modes you have your basic arcade mode which you complete to unlock new characters you also have a vs. mode a team battle mode which is very enjoyable a survival mode a time attack mode and a practice mode all of these modes offer allot of replayability as it is easy to dump countless hours into any of these modes the combat system is still excellent to this day the amount of combos that each character can do is pretty substantial and you will discover new moves without being too overwhelmed there also are n't really any cheap tactics unlike some of the more recent iterations of tekken such as excessive juggling).overall this game is one of the best fighting games that i have ever played with plenty of characters to learn plenty of modes to choose from amazing looking backgrounds and a terriffic combat system there is no reason to skip this game if you still have a ps1 ps2 buy this game i recommend this game wholeheartedly and you wo n't regret it at all
this is my family s favorite fighting game from my six year old daughter on up to my 10yr old son they love this game   the graphics along with the sounds and moves are excellent also there is a great character selection to choose from
the sequel to the very popular tekken tekken 2 takes everything that the original had and expands upon it more characters more levels more moves tekken 2 is a classic and should be in the library of any fighting game lover the combat in tekken is one of best ever there are so many possible combinations it 's almost impossible to remember them all each tekken gets better and better another thing i love about this game is the music it suits the stages and characters well
tekken 2 it the huge sequel to the best selling fighter tekken this game includes advanced fighting and secret characters to die for not only theat but it had a plethera of gameshark codes to make the game easier this game also introduced the 10 hit combo the automatic win namco has done it again and they have done it with flying colors this game is a must have for the fighting fans
same goes for tekken 2 played but never owned now that i 'm officially the best tekken player period the urge to own all of them even the first 2 just consumed me ....
what is there to say this game has everything you want in a fighting game plenty of characters to choose from and the gameplay is top notch for a ps1 game definitely one of my favorites
this game works great on my ps3 i would recommend this game for all arial fighting game thanks again love you guys thanks
this has got to be the best one of the playstation one series can't wait for my ps2 to arrive to continue the series hopefully they will be better than ace combat 3 which was an utter disappointment
this is an excellent game for spending some time on i have played it before on a demo cd long ago so that 's why i decided to buy it it 's about passing missions and destroying planes bases ships etc it find it very fun the missions happen in different ambiences and time of the day which makes it more interesting you can get new planes with different attributes according to what you want a great title for the ps
there seems to be a curse on ace combat akin to that on the star trek movies and by that i mean that the odd numbered members of the series are forgettable while the even numbered save perhaps zero but zero is the absence of value right are stellar ace combat 6 awesome ace combat 5 uneven and over too quick ace combat 4 perfect ace combat 3 had half the missions removed for the u.s. release ace combat 1 air combat stone age and ace combat 2 ... if you 're into classic gaming and love the playstation and especially if you love air combat games this is a definite buy the sheer imagination that was put into this game is wonderful you have night missions sea missions desert missions high altitude missions ravine missions and oh so wonderful city liberation mission i've said it before and i 'll say it again there 's more to graphics than just how many polygons you have and how detailed your textures are graphics even low res graphics can and should be beautiful and beautiful this game is in all its playstation polygon glory the lighting the jets the far off cityscapes and the clouds in the sky it 's all just beautiful to me at least and better yet unlike other air combat games of the era everything moves at a rocketing speed even when you get close to the ground where other games look like you 're moving in slow motion the game keeps a great sensation of speed the controls are uniformly tight utilizing the analog controls to the full and you can bank and pitch completely upside down something that many similar arcade style games of the time do n't allow the game also features a wonderful cockpit view that brings you into the experience even more there 's also voice chatter as you go some nice arcade style music and full voice command briefings nice of course you also hear bingo every time you hit a target and get a comment every time you miss too but that 's just keeping with the arcade feel the enemy a.i. might not be as good as you can get now but it 's definitely good for when this game came out and you can still get shot down if you play on hard and do n't watch yourself in my opinion this game was the first great console air combat game if you love arcade style air combat games and play playstation games you just have to get this game
for the quot;ace combat&quot initiated this game is a lot better that the original quot;ace combat&quot for it 's graphics and play although i have to say how much i enjoyed quot;ace combat&quot too in the beginning not only have the grapics been improved but the game now includes a scannar that actually tellls you which way the enemy planes are pointing a must for the correct deployment of missiles missions are plentiful and in addition to the possibility to select a wingman or indeed wing&quot;woman&quot as sexual equality aware namco has included you can even direct him or her to take on a certain part of the mission or do the mission without support as you wish there are the usual night missions and canyon runs and plenty of planes to choose from game action is very smooth too the planes available in the more advanced stages of the missions are great an enjoyable game
my first ace combat game was electrosphere or number 3 in 98 so 12 years later i decided to give this one a go   it 's a lot of fun and after you configure your controls to how you like it becomes even better   compared to 3 this one is a bit more fast paced but the graphics are noticeably lower in quality the one quarrel i have though it is a given for all pre 96ish i think playstation games is you ca n't use the analog sticks which i always used in the third ac and even though it 's just a little stick not having it really takes away from the flying feel
this is a pretty fun game if you like hardcore killing games then this is for you this game rocks
i 've played this game when i first got the playstation around the year of 1997 first mature rated game and after all of these years i return back to the dungeon to claim victory luckily i did deathtrap dungeon is not for the gamer who is use to fps fighters or 3d games that runs on the quake engine this game is for collector 's of games when they were in the early stages of become platinum hits in the world of gaming as of today the game works fine but keep in mind that when you order this game get ready for a journey and one heck of a challenge its not hard but this is a game that you really need patience with
i liked the story and the graphics were n't that bad but the main problem was with the controls and the camera angles at times if not for that this game would 've been great
if you love castles goblins monsters demon vixens and skeletons swinging swords this game is for you i thought the graphics were excellent and solving the levels wasn t difficult some may fine the dismemberments a little to gross but my kids enjoyed it
maybe i just am a mediocre gamer but this game is a challenge from hell.message me if you have beat this one
i would recommend getting this game for many reasons you have 4 characters to choose from you can pick the route you want the levels are well designed along with the chaacters the fighting style are also great you get to pick up weapons use tit against them the playstation version is the best one to buy
throughout the years there have been dozens of street fighter ripoffs including fighting force this is basically the same as all the others but it does have some surprisingly decent graphics for a ps1 game
you know you 're in trouble when other terrible video games are compared to you though only a little worse than charlie 's angels gamecube and not as bad as hidden invasion playstation2 fighting force is the difinitive bad adventure fighting game that fits on the same crap list as burning fight even brawl bros and peace keepers are better than this and that 's saying a lot you get your pick from four forgettable crime fighters pixie pig tailed alana gruff hawk leather pants wearing look at me i 'm nabiki tendo mace and prison inmate smasher they 're out to get a psychopath who believes the world should have ended at the beginning of 2000 a.d. and is now determined to make that happen maybe he should have waited through the other 23 times it turned new years day across the world many sega saturn owners did n't realize then how lucky they were that this game was cancelled on their system nintendo 64 owners were not so lucky and i was n't so lucky after getting the playstation version the controls are sloppy the hit detection is horrible especially the dash attacks and the character animation is almost jerky enough to look like an old claymation cartoon if there is one redeeming factor it is the music though not great the musical scores in this game are a nice touch the only reason you should buy this disc is to pop it into a cd playing radio or computer and skip track one since that 's just a data track ... meaning all you will hear if anything is an annoying buzz start on track 2 sit back and enjoy the only good thing about this game
this game is very fun i have only played a demo that my cousin has but i 'm dying to pick up a copy the demo is short and we like to come up with different themes to it like we 're going to a party at the building at the end of the demo this game is kind of funny some of the enemies are pure fools i like to run around the van with them chasing then i turn around and and knock the crud out of them i like the guns and sticks that you can pick up and when you run out of ammo you can throw your gun at the enemies that 's pretty funny too the characters have awesome moves i love fighting games and this is one of my favorites if you like fighting games and games that are just plain fun buy this game
i played this game when i was a kid and forgot all about it then remembered it ordered it and have been having fun playing it
fighting force was the wanna be streets of rage for playstation if you grew up in the 90 's and owned a sega you 'll know what i 'm talking about the game had tons of flaws such as the lo fidelity sound effects sssshhhhheeeewwwmmm and the blocky pc like design of the characters heck it looked like a windows 95 platform game there are four characters to choose from two chicks a big giant and the handsome one they each have their own moves but have serious shortcomings smasher can take a lot of damage and deal it too but he 's slow as a mule hawk is a decent fighter but is open to a lot of hits alana and mace are both quick alana moreso but are weak and fragile the game was unduly hard due to the overhaul of the game 's engine back then games overloaded easily especially if they were not rendered correctly the load times on this game tell you there 's a lot of extra space here an obvious pitfall is when there are many enemies items on the screen it evokes slow command response but only from players controllers remember trying to grab a guy and your player executes an air grab 1 second after you press the button this resulted in getting beat up from 5 or more directions and having a briefcase hurled at your head not fun items were also a bother as you found that punching a guy mysteriously involved you picking up a crate first then you got kicked in the shin and you dropped the crate as two more guys fired shots at you and you 're spinning through the air fun yet when you want to pull a pole off the wall you instead invoke a reverse backhand that misses and makes you look like an idiot and for that ugly move sir you get a pipe to the face you eventually either get frustrated with the game or you learn to live with it the game experience for me is always bitter sweet because even though i 've learned to live with the quirks they still get in my way the game gets progressively harder as you advance through the levels and sometimes you white knuckle your controller to keep from using a continue which by the way starts you over on the level ... totally bogus when you finally do finish the game it seems underwhelming you 'll see what i mean when you finish it all in all despite its obvious and frustrating flaws the game is still a classic if you do n't own it you owe it to yourself to take a trip back in time re live the polygonal loading screen glory
got the game after i came home from work it was on the kitchen table my brother probably got to the mailbox first i hope it is good my little nephew wanted to play it with me
alrighty let me just start off by saying do n't let people who play final fantsay 7 sway your judgement about this   while final fantsay 7 is an amazing game it varies very heavily from fighting force so what some people like fun fighting games)and others love rpg gamers we are at war with the worlds   it 's better to agree to disagree here   okay let us begin with the review   i love this game   from the very beginning where you can choose your favorite character mace daniels is my personal favorite to the last moment when you deliver a crushing blow to your enemy   it is ingenius   i love how you can pick up weapons like guns and bats and that you can deliver really snazzy throws blocks   like people have said it is like a streets of rage for the now   let me break it down overall for you graphics- compared to now it is not up to bar   compare it to when it frist came out bar none   5/5 although the animation can sometime slow down sound- ai n't nothing more prettier than hearing your enemies bone crunch   5/5control- obviously this is the black sheep of the family   the controls are clunky and choppy and sometimes they interfere with the great gaming experience   thank god for infinite health codes   3/5 ouch)overall- aside from the controls being what they are the game is a smooth ride of fun fighting and brainless beat-'em up   i feel this game is totally undercredited and that we need to change that   only you can prevent forest fires
first and best good to play with friends but this game can be a bit aimless at times   have n't touched it in years though
this game lacked the ability to live up to name tomb raider its more of a city raider half the levels deal with city time scenery and 80 of the enemies are humans more like a 007 than a tomb raider but the game play is fun in the cities venice so i ca nt complain too much just was nt feelin the whole china scene i liked to level skip those and the twist at the end was a lil boost so all in all ill give it 5stars but it lacked challenge for me i beat it in a week just run around and jump for the most part
tomb raider 2 is my absolute favourite playstation game of all time i bought the game in december 1997 around the same time i got my playstation but i never really liked tomb raider 2 and only managed to get halfway through the first level before forgetting about it for a while four years later in the summer of 2001 i dug it out again and decided to give it a go with the help of a strategy guide what a shock i got!after the phenomenal worldwide success of the original tomb raider in november 1996 the eidos interactive guys put together the sequel which in a rare case surpasses the original with flying colours to save the game in the first you had to find a crystal before continuing wheras in tomb raider 2 you have the ability to save the game whenever you feel like this comes as a great help especially before taking off into a running jump over deep caverns and steep slopes lara also has much greater weaponary comapred to the last game the first game featured pistols shotgun and uzis that was about it but with this game you get weapons such as the grenade launcher and an m-16 assault rifle while tomb raider 1 focused more on enemies in animal form tomb raider 2 has a more worldly feel because the foes are mostly human but the most notable change on tomb raider 2 is the welcome addition of vehicles tomb raider featured none what so ever but tomb raider 2 has a wide variety from the enjoyable speedboat in venice and the snowmobile in tibetian foothills lara also took advantage of a make over the graphics where background scenery is concerned is still the same as the first game but lara herself has changed a lot her hair is no longer tied in a bun but flows freely down her back in a pony tail the reason this was n't featured in the first game is because the technology was n't good enough for her hair to be in a pony tail they could n't get it to move in motion with her body rather silly when you think about it now lara also possesses the ability to climb certain surfaces the improved engine also served better lighting facilities which allowed ms croft the ability to wield flares whenever she finds herself in dark areas when it comes to the levels the highlights are venice offshore rig tibetian foothills short but sweet involves driving to one end of a road over pits to find a key before driving all the way back to open a door that allows you to exit and begin the next level barkhang monastery hint whatever you do don't shoot the monks they are here to help they will dispatch any henchmen who try to kill you so you do n't have to kill them accidently shoot one and you 'll have hundreds of monks trying to kill you and temple of xian overall grade 10/10tomb raider 2 is in my opinion the greatest playstation game there has ever been yes the graphics are laughable now because they have come so far since especially on the playstation 2 and x box but it all boils down to how enjoyable the game is and in that category it is still the most enjoyable and exciting game ever hundreds of titles try to replicate the suspense and adventure that is seen in the tomb raider games and fail miserably buy this now from amazon it 'd be a shame not to and to ignore it would be missing out on one of the most classic video games of all time ...
they took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good these games are still great for people looking for a challenge but i would advise first time players to play the series in order as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult to learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you need to know in order to play the next as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises but even though there is n't as much actual 34;tomb raiding&#34 in this one it is definitely a step up from the previous version also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where lara 's house is raided by a mafia strike team although does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game the extended version has two more levels but it 's only for the pc
from the great wall of china to the canals of venice tomb raider ii is the rare case in which a sequel is better than an original in fact i find this game to be my favorite of the series in it the legendary lara croft sets out to find the dagger of xion in her quest she navigates the globe and even takes a couple of trips to strange and magical new worlds tomb raider ii offers significant improvements over the original and its game play exceeds the other games that follow in the series the game has drastically overhauled weapons and artificial intelligence though the puzzles are not as hard as later versions they still are quite difficult lara has new moves many new weapons and more dangerous foes what more could a tomb raider fan or even the casual gamer ask for?i highly recommend this game whether you are an avid tomb raider fan or somebody new to the series i do n't believe you will be disappointed in fact you will probably find many hours of action filled entertainment and if you do enjoy it i strongly recommend other games in this series
by far this game it 's much more fair than the original tomb raider this one at least let you safe the progress anywhere in the game without looking for any type of save crystals which made original game incredibly difficult and punishing   this sequel may not be the best game out there for the ps1 but at least it 's a bit more fun to play
this game is great to get into and back again never mind so the level 's are great you get to go tibet china venice and a sunken ship the background is not so good but it 's ok and you get small heath and large heath packs these heath packs will be somewhere in the game keep a good eye out for them arm yourself with automatic pistols harpoon gun rocket launcher m16 rifle uzis shotguns flares and more!kill them or be kill by monks yetis great white sharks killer eels dobermans and more be careful please!!your quest is for the dagger of xian.it 's hidden somewhere out there i know do you?and the good news is lara is back
i recently started re playing this game to find that it is actually quite fun i remember first playing this game when i was a little kid at my friends house but never gave it any attention i just thought of it to be boring and hard but since i remembered it i sadly asked him if i could borrow it and he said sure keep it so i did anyways when i started it up i remembered everything about the first mission very hard especially without anymore ps1 memory cards when i finally beat the first mission the wall it sadly took me hours because after those tumbling rocks after you you got ran over easy and died every time you die you have to restart the whole mission so this is what took me the most time soon i got on to the second mission i got pretty far but then the disc old and scratched up quit on me it kept freezing i have had this problem many times before on the first mission so i had to restart it back up again after that i pretty much quit this is why i keep all of my games in their cases so they will work about 10 years later sorry for such a bad review but later i looked up online and watched the whole thing well the missions in speedy time and saw how good the game layouts and graphics were i really enjoyed this game well the first couple missions of it so maybe i will buy a ps1 memory card and start to savin soon
the first tomb raider was a classic in terms of its 3d gameplay sense of exploration through massive levels and a unique main character   the 2nd installment in the tr series is not much different   the levels are still huge and exploration is still the name of the game   but this time around the environments and enemies are more varied there are more action based enemy sequences than the first and the difficulty level has been approriately increased   in terms of the level of challenge i feel that this is the best in the series   the later tomb raider series felt frustrating and downright cheap at times   this one is definitely not a cakewalk but is very possible without a strategy guide   you do n't feel as though you have to play for half an hour just to get into the next room   progress is slow but steady and you do n't ever need 6 or 7 different items to move on   progress is more based on actually getting where you want to go rather than finding the right items or hitting the right combination of switches   some of the level designs are incredible such as the venice based levels the opera house the beastly barkhang monestary and the massive temple of xian   this is the key strength of the first two tr installments and why the more recent ones have been less inspiring   resourcefulness and attention to the environment is extremely key as medipacks are in light supply in this game   also every level has 3 secrets in the form of dragons   you do not receive the bonus items unless you find all 3 dragons in the level making exploration even more vital in building your inventory   finding at least 2 of the dragons in every level should be quite easy but some levels have one especially well hidden dragon   the gold dragons in the first two levels are remarkably difficult but the reward of finding them especially the first one is worth it   if you did n't like the first tomb raider this game wo n't change your mind   if you were blown away by the first installment or even the 3rd 4th or 5th then this game is a real treat
i recently backtracked and played all of the earlier tomb raider games avoid angel of darkness   horrible game   tr2 is about as fun as they come graphics are outdated of course but there is so much to do and to much fun to be had   the game is long keeps your interest has plenty of cool weapons and a good story   i 'd love to see this game redone with today 's technology   10 out of 10" if you 're a tr fan and have n't played this i 'd advise that you do
tomb raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now lara kicks way more ... in this one then in the first some of the reasons why are listed here excellent 3d levels such as -1 the great wall2 venice3 bartolli 's hideout4 opera house5 offshore rig6 diving area7 40 fathoms8 wreck of the mario doria9 living quarters10 the deck11 tibetan foothills12 barkhang monestary13 catacombs of the talion14 ice palace15 temple of xian16 floating islands17 dragon 's lairepilouge home sweet homekick ... weapons like -pistolsuzismagnumsshotgungrenade launcherm16 machine gunharpoon gunawesome new enemy 's like -t rex'sraptorsguardian of the talionand a dragontomb raider 2 is an awesome game but my favorite in the series has to be tomb raider 3!below i have included a list in order of my favorite tomb raider games:1 tomb raider 32 tomb raider 4 last revelations3 tomb raider 24 tomb raider 5 chronicles5 tomb raider ...
i was only 5 years old my first time playing this game back in christmas of 1997 i was never able to get past the first couple levels then but i always loved this game it was magic back then the graphics were also great then second time around i was 12 and it was 2004 i was able to finally finish the entire game and find all the secrets to now in 2012 i had the urge to replay this game again to get those feeling of being so young i 'm 19 and the magic is completely gone and for one reason.be warned ...... if you have a full hd tv and have a ps3 and bought a physical copy of this game ...... the playback visuals of this game will be absolutely horrible it completely hinders your ability to even play through the game because everything is so pixelated if you will like i never remembered this game looking so bad before but i have to assume it had always looked this way but i was in a different era of technology then hd tvs are completely unforgiving to these types of games i 'm not sure if the the digital copy available on the psn is any better but the actual physical copy is not meant for a hd display even in it respective aspect ratio maybe just playing this game on standard definition tv might help but i have n't tried that either i will just have to remember the game like when i was young as the best ps1 game i ever played and then later the only one i ever beat to the future gamers
this is a good game here and i recommend it to anyone who likes adventure type games 10 out of 10
a major tomb raider fan i decided to play all the games over again and finished both part one and now part two and they 're both still as great as i remember i think both are strong and worthwhile games with great plots but tomb raider two is more tough but that 's the point of a sequel it 's longer or at least it felt that way especially when it came to the ocean part of the game yet i enjoyed playing it both tomb raider one and two have interesting plots and both are different in tomb raider two it has to deal with a dagger that throughout the story grows more important to find and soon you go through many different levels than you did on tomb raider one- including the floating islands- which is one weird level but very fascinating my favorite levels were in venice the places in tibet and yes the floating islands home sweet home level was a little scary- being attacked in her own home!- but i thought it was a good twist the ending itself was tougher than the first one that 's for sure and i did say a few curse words while trying to finish the game but eventually when i did finish i knew that it was worthwhile i had to get a strategy guide nonetheless to beat this game because indeed in many levels it was a little too tough for me to figure out but then there 's no shame in getting a little help overall the game is more hard and challenging and just as creative in plot as part one was the storylines are way good i enjoyed it and i recommend it to everyone who loved part one
this game is amazing the level design and all the awesome puzzles make this game the best tr game i 've ever played this one is perfect to start if you are too young and never had a chance to play the tomb raider classics from ps1 after playing this one play 5 then 1   then 4 tomb raider ... the best series ever especially the classics ones from 1996 2000
this is one of those classic games that everyone who was a fan of playstation 1 must own aside from the 1st tomb raider of course got it used but it works great
a game that set the standard for the series imo clearly the newest one out there set the bar for the entire franchise though
ya know i remember playing this game as a kid i could n't find this game anywhere and i did n't want to continue playing the anniversary or the windows version so i decided to buy this game as a kid it has a great storyline and for everyone who likes indiana jones then you 'd love this game pros or cons):easy to maneuverchallenging puzzles in which you have to think do n't worry because it 's not like balder 's gate or anything that brainstorming unique storyline involving atlantiscons or pros):low quality graphics then again it is from the ps1 so do n't expect 128 bit graphics;)no music except for select portions where there are orchestral themessurrealism constant element of surprisepersonally i like most of the cons but those are most of the things people i 've known complained about also if anyone buys this game then i have to tell you this please if you 're gon na use cheats ... then at least beat the game before doing so
if i could have give 6 stars for this game i would have   i played this originally when it first came out in 1996   back then games such as resident evil and tomb raider were ground breaking milestones in entertainment known as video games   i wo n't talk about resident evil here because everyone knows about that tomb raider was the first game to give players control of a character in a true 3d environment   sure you had games like doom and wolfenstien but they played only on a single plane with your character spinning on an axis   tomb raider allowed you to control lara the feminine version of indiana jones an use the environments such as cliffs roofs etc to progress through the levels   level design in tomb raider is really what the game is centered around   beautiful stunning breath taking eerie surreal all describe the level design here   nothing short of ingenious the game mechanics and control of lara were never the best but they were also adequate to get the job done   lara spins on a fixed axis when the player turns left and right and forward makes her run in the direction she is facing   turning can sometimes be a chore especially when the action is turned up a notch   luckily the circle button makes lara do a somersault tumble for a quick quot;about face&quot   the shimmying and climbing from ledge to ledge and jumping has always been amazing   combine that with sliding down angular rock formations and time jumps and grabs to ledges and you are bound to fall in love with the action that eidos developed note this kind of mechanics shined most for me in this game as opposed to all the predecessors including angel of darkness for ps2   this kind of action became less and less as the series went on save for last revelation maybe   the swimming sequences and puzzles are also a really wonderful treat as well there are plenty of surprises in this game that i do n't want to give away however i will tell you that some of the levels in the game will stick in your memory for a long long time after   for example quot;the god room&quot of st. francis folly has got to be one of the best and most memorable and beautiful levels of any game that i 've played so why am i writing this review now 7 years after the release date   for a few reasons   first being that i ca n't get the game out of my head for more than a few months   every six months i go back to it   the second reason is that when i bought a ps2 i knew i would be playing the original tomb raider again and wanted that backward capability   and third and quite possibly the most important and the reason i titled this review quot;dear eidos&quot is that angel of darkness was the single reason that i sold my ps2 for an x box   at first i enjoyed aod but the game has rampant problems   i 've always welcomed a new tomb raider game in my life and gave aod more than one chance   i loved all the other ps1 tomb raider games including iii which got a lot of harsh and unwarranted criticisms in my mind but whatever   i hated aod and want eidos to know that   and fourth reason is that i repurchased the new and compact psone last week   i still own my tomb raider from back in the day   last night i played it and the magic was back like from the first time i played it   sure the graphics feel older but they are by no means bad at all considering that i play games like halo crimson skies prince of persia and rainbow six 3 on the x box   there will always be a large place in my geeky video gaming heart for this true classic eidos take the power back
oh yes .... this game is what it 's all about   sure it looks totally archaic now with its primitive low polygon 3d cf lara 's madonna style pyramid breasts and jerky low frame rate but who cares   tomb raider was one of the first fully realized 3d games with huge environments and a camera that lets you explore them fully something next gen developers still seem to have a problem with sometimes and of course best of all an action hero that players across the board could instantly connect with   yes lara croft men want her women want to be her ... lol   forget about her later misadventures on celluloid and worst of all the ps2 platform   even on the ps1 all the new innovations in graphics and ai that cropped up in subsequent tr installments could n't improve upon the originality of gameplay you have here in the debut   the puzzles the secrets the at times relentless action this game has it all much like indiana jones we first encounter lara as she explores some ruins in south america allegedly the village of vilcabamba an actual archeological site in ecuador although as it appears in the game it 's more of a generic hotch pot of pre columbian art and architecture   of course you have the rolling ball traps everywhere and of course she eventually finds a golden idol more nods to indy   later she explores las vegas versions of rome and egypt slaughtering more endangered species in the process than are even left on the planet peta just loved this game before proceeding to where else atlantis which is naturally swarming with freakish and bloodthirsty mutants   all this because she 's in search of an artifact whose magical powers if in the wrong hands could destroy the world or something it 's easy to punch holes in the ridiculous plot but that does n't affect the entertainment value again just like with indy you know it 's stupid but you 're more than willing to suspend disbelief just to go along with the wild ride   getting through the levels is not always easy you 'll need to sharpen both your combat and puzzle solving skills   there 's also a lot of replay value owing to the oftentimes diabolically hidden secrets which usually contain caches of weapons and the infamous medi paks "play this game it 's almost like a cool retro thing to do now and forget about everything that came after   they have a new tr in the works now but it 's got a lot of bad karma to overcome ... so far nothing has matched this original masterpiece
so this is where it all began the original tomb raider in november 1996 britain was changing with the phenomenal success of the spice girls and the phrase girl power there was n't a better time to bring out an all female computer game heroine who kicked rear enter lara croft the game went straight to no.1 all over the world and shifted more than 10 million copies to become the biggest selling playstation game of all time lara soon became a cultural icon gracing hundreds of magazine covers the world over and not just computer magazines mainstream magazines such as rolling stone and time undoubtedly the biggest magazine names in the world four sequels followed in the form of tomb raider ii tomb raider iii tomb raider iv the last revelation and tomb raider iv chronicles the five games have sold a combined total of 40 million worldwide and secured eidos interactive and more importantly lara croft and tomb raider a place in video gaming history as undoubtedly the greatest most popular and enjoyable computer games of all time the story of tomb raider is simple really lara croft is a semi famous archeologist adventurer and has been hired by a mysterious woman natla last name unknown to search the globe for an ancient artifact known as the scion that is beleived to have come from the lost city of atlantis lara sets off on her travels to find this artifact but before she can find it she must search other areas of the world to find clues and hints that will open the way forward to her ultimate prize around halfway through the game while uncovering clues about the artifact in question lara also unveils the truth about natla a story told through amazing cut scenes the storyline is intriguing to say the least and keeps you on the very edge of your seat as you beg to know more yet never for the game to end the game begins with simple pedestrian levels for newcomers to get to grips with the controls the enemies are only small in the first few levels bats dogs etc that can be eliminated with a single shot of lara 's pistols a weapon that she has with her always that features an unlimited amount of ammo the game has a massive 16 levels that will keep you playing for months it took me 10 months to complete in fact i finished the week tomb raider ii came out so once i 'd finished with the first i spent the next 10 months playing the second one this has been a regular oocurance and has resulted in me playing all five tomb raider games for around 6 years without a break i remember the days when i bought this game ... i was only 10 and it scared me to death the enemies may not look very real but remember that controlling lara is you control her every move so her life is in your hands at the time the game was released the graphics were unbelievable and the scenery breathtaking the former is not so much now but the latter still stands graphics in computer games have come a very long way since 1996 but half an hours play on tomb raider with ms croft and its superior excellence shines through the final levels are set in and around atlantis and are classic moments in video gaming history from the rocky cliffs of asia to the hot muggy forests of south america and the haunting and eerie lost island of atlantis there 's something here for everyone buy it now!overall grade 10/10all in all tomb raider is the ultimate playstation game everything about this game is so enchanting and memorable the atmosphere the sounds the animals make the noises lara makes when falling off a rock the music that cues to tell you something exciting is about to happen everything this is a true classic in video gaming history that deserves all the critical praise it recieved 6 years ago if you have n't got tomb raider in your playstation games collection it is not complete only when you purchase all 5 tomb raider games will your collection be complete with the soon to be released lara croft timb raider vi the angel of darkness all six tomb raider will keep me playing for decades literally i will still be playing tomb raider when i 'm 60 years old and i 'm sure i 'll not be the only one ...
despite awkward controls that seem to be designed more for a computer than a game system and get used to it because that lasts until the ps2 era-- aka the sixth game in the series this has to be one of the funnest games of all time it gives a challenge on multiple levels inspires you to keep playing to find out what happens next as things get progressively more dangerous and more bizarre was re made as tomb raider anniversary but i 'd prefer the original any day
from the ruins of rome to the futuristic setting of atlantis tomb raider takes the gamer through a variety of wonderful worlds   unlike its sequels it stays in the tombs and out of other settings   i believe that it is one of the best games ever made and it certainly is a classic   however i believe that its sequels in many aspects overshadow it the scenery in tomb raider is better than most games although it is mostly cubed and flat   the game play and plot are wonderful and the graphics and sounds are acceptable   however the artificial intelligence enemies are less than intelligent and the gamer is often left feeling underestimated with the ease of some of the puzzles   laura 's moves are limited and the weapons supply is less than perfect i would recommend this game to any fan of the tomb raider series and to the average gamer   however i do feel that other versions have better qualities   tomb raider ii offers wonderful ai and is perhaps the best for a gamer seeking combat tomb raider iii combines the better aspects of the previous two and tomb raider the last revelation offers the best plot and character mobility   if you are looking to stay in the tombs or if you are not into puzzles stick with this game   however do n't miss out on the other great qualities the tomb raider series offers
like i 've said before tomb raider will always stand as one of the most influential games of all time back in 1996 the only competition in this genre was mario 64 nowadays every other game is a 3d adventure in the vain of tomb raider" the game is very solid well placed and thought provoking puzzles some nice action great graphics which still hold up today and lots of fun the only complaint is the lack of a decent ending and that i have to shoot a fellow human at least 60 times in order to kill him how untrealistic is that?while tr 2 is the best in the series this one will be the most remembered story 6/10graphics 8/10sound 7/10fun 8/10
god it was ages ago when i last played the original quot;tomb raider&quot the first time i played it maybe six years ago i was amazed and frightened i was frightened because of the very first level you know the awry music dark caves and vicious bats wolves and bears that will always be my first memory of playing quot;tomb raider&quot even though it 's dated now it still lives up to its name despite several sequels and dissapointing movies what really made this game famous and made playstaion fun was the goddess lara croft she 's absolutely gorgeous you play the adventrous archaeologist in a quest to recover an ancient artifact croft travels the world in style from peru to egypt and to the lost city of atlantis i think that 's the story for the game i lost track since i have n't played this game for awhile but what was original about this game was n't really lara 's beauty it was the gameplay the gamer has to solve complexed puzzles battle hard enemies(including dinosaurs and go through hidden rooms and collect treasures from ancient cities there is also a good amount of weapons for lara including her trademark dual pistols there is also some health packs in case she gets hurt in fact she gets hurt alot no human being could ever do the things she does the very physical lara jumps impossible feats does handstands and survives in very dangerous situations she 's a female indiana jones!anyway quot;tomb raider&quot is an entertaining game it has good graphics solid gameplay and lara croft is hot but the quot;tomb raider&quot series has lost track of its self the gameplay is all ready becoming old and its lack of innovation has n't made gamers happy including myself only part 2 is the best sequel but the original game that made lara croft famous is a must own game for every classic game collection
i 'm going to fly in the face of convention wisdom and assert that tomb raider is not a good game i like the concept the puzzle solving and exploration i like that it 's a great diversion from the standard shoot em up the problem is with the tedious game play the game is tough just from the mental standpoint and it takes some effort to figure out what you 're supposed to be doing in each level but that 's part of the fun figuring things out unfortunately it 's moving through the levels and getting from point a to point b that is problematic there are way too many places where you have to make a pinpoint precision jump or other move with absolutely no margin for error in some cases this means you fall somewhere and have to climb back to your starting point or in some cases you die meaning you have to start the whole level over again and after trying one of these jumps over and over and over you finally get frustrated and give up there were instances where i tried a jump over and over and then suddenly made the jump and had no idea what i had done differently from the previous numerous attempts for any game to be that touchy is just a disgrace it 's too bad i think i could have liked this game but the tedious pinpoint controller movements ulitmately ruined the game for me i know it 's one of psx quot;greatest hits&quot and very popular but if do n't like tedious games you 'll want to avoid this one
tomb raider was one of the first games i completed and it was tough really challenging throughout and educational one of the most intriguing and fun games to pass while shooting at random things and at dinosaurs and bears and other animals really great
brought this game for myself it brought back memories when i was 6 playing this all summer long game came as described and fast also
it 's great to play if you have nothing to do well anyaway the level 's are so cool it 's get 's better each time you go to a new level each level have something you must do before you go on there are alot of little places that you can fine little small heath pack 's get those you will need it because there is always someone trying to stop you and kill you o if you fine anything useful get that too sometimes the informate is right there in your face you just got to look that 's all this was my only game that i own for my playstation that the time i did't know if i sould play it or leave it alone will i play it and you know what i like it for once a woman is doing the thing and i said it 's about time do you know what i mean??well go have fun i did take your time and do it right i did and i got good at
i ve had tomb raider since july and this game is off the meters when i first played it i was frustrated with the controls but once u learn them this game is the best the worlds are long and puzzling but its never too hard to finish the action and suspense make u feel like its a movie i reccomend this to anybody who likes action or 007 fans like me you will love it trust me
i absolutely love tomb raider it is definitely my favorite game of all time it has everything you need to make a wonderfully fun game there is action and adventure thriller problem solving and an entertaining story line i love the challenge of the problem solving it is n't a game you can finish in a couple hours but take a long time to get through all of the different puzzles you definitely get your moneys worth with play time on this game it will always keep you thinking i could n't ask for a better game
i did n't beat the game so i guess my opinion should n't count ... but here it is this game has great historical value prince sands of time soul reaver god of war and many others are based on some things that tomb raider made popular game would be perfect if save points were better placed it would be best to have a save game option at any point but those were old times ... what i disliked i beat mexico levels playing each one two to six hours i got to st francis folly level things started to look really tiresome first i spent too much energy beating pillar sub level and did n't have spare medpack reaching ground floor i restarted i got enough energy by reaching ground but was n't able to beat pool puzzle on top then i figured out that i should have gone to the ground without using save crystals open all puzzle doors top level door is connected to ground switch and then climb back up ... which means another level restart maybe this game is for hardcore fans but i am not one of them ... i got frustrated enough to quit
i had to go back and play this game after playing and loving tomb raider anniversary playing anniversary and then going back to the original really makes you appreciate just how awesome this game was the level design was just amazing with all the different areas you get to explore i have n't played the original since it first came out so i did n't realize just how much crystal dynamics took from this game they took a lot some of the level designs are almost identical the biggest difference between the old and the new is the difficulty anniversary is way easier but not because the puzzles or enemies are easier it 's because of the controls back in tomb raider 1 the controls were pretty terrible but what do you expect from a game breaking new ground in the world of 3d so i 'll over look it and give it a 5 out of 5
i have n't played tomb raider 1 in a long time but a month or so ago i found it at a used cd store and bought it i just finished the game and am still thrilled at how exciting and tough this game still is the plot is interesting enough for you to continue caring for the story and lara croft makes a fun character to use to get to your next destination she is strong knows how to carry her weapons jump great heights and is truly fearless when it comes to dinosaurs bad guys and even messed up creatures she meets up with in the end you have to constantly be kept on your toes throughout the game and the settings themselves are yes very old compared to nowadays improvements but for back then were well done and even nowadays not bad at least to me this game is a fun challenge and i recommend it to anyone interested in adventure games for lara will take you on great journeys in this game my favorite is where she is facing a sphinx- like statue- now that was a fun level tomb raider is one of the greatest storylines ever created and that is why it is so popular even nowadays the older stuff is better though aka like 1- 4 of the tomb raider series is the best to me- everything after 4 seems to have gone downhill angel of darkness honestly i could n't even finish it was so bad so take my advice and try out the older version of tomb raiders first they are much better and more exciting
this is the best game i have yet to play   it took me six months to finally defeat figure out and fight my way to the end of this game   this game was like a very suspenseful movie that i was controlling many times in the game i was actually sweating from fear you don t know what s waiting for you around each corner waiting to jump out at you and scare the crap out of you even my family and onlookers were startled or to afraid to play this game because of the   realism captured in enormous worlds and creepy cd sounds
if you are a fan of tr you 're gon na love to have this one in your collection the graphics are better though on the pc version ...
the original tomb raider was a landmark game for the playstation and the start of a very long running series it holds up well but is a definite acquired taste tomb raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress lara croft being hired by business woman jacqueline natla to search an ancient cavern in peru for a piece of the scion an ancient talisman of great power however after finding the piece lara is betrayed by jacqueline 's men now it 's a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the scion before jacqueline attains its mythical power tomb raider is an early playstation game and unfortunately the graphics have n't aged very well although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey despite this the game 's length is impressive there are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game lara moves in a very stiff fashion her controls are tank like and you have to hold down a button for her to walk she takes very long jumps but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases fortunately there is a training mission where lara instructs you on how to play in her home the game is primarily a puzzle platformer each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skills scattered throughout the many ruins and caves are vicious animals and hired goons all chomping at the bit to impede your progress this is where combat comes into play lara starts off the game with twin pistols that have unlimited ammo through out the game you will find a variety of firearms however these weapons do have limited ammo but the pistols ensure you will always have a fighting chance in battle the last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game the pc version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted the console versions of the game on playstation and sega saturn do not have this luxury you can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow unfortunately once a crystal is used it is gone this makes it really difficult when you 've got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you save this game has many flaws but it is a very rewarding experience i would recommend the game for those expecting a challenge the later games in the tomb raider series ironed out many of the issues experienced here if you 're curious about the beginning of the franchise you wo n't be disappointed but maybe a little stressed for classic pc gamers i 'd recommend tomb raider unfinished business this is the original game plus two bonus missions with two new levels a piece
the story line for both the orginal tomb raider and tomb raider anniversary are the same i would consider the old tomb raider is more harder then the new tomb raider anniversary if you like better graphics and such get tomb raider anniversary if you like harder challenge get the old version either one is both good on game play
the first installment in the series turned many heads and imaginations of many   a good flick if you 're bored and looking for an adnventure   can tend to be frustrating
this takes back memories when i first played tomb raider   it 's both chalenging and fun   its remake is just added stuff and newly improved stages
i hate this game   let me state right away graphics in a wwe wrestling game mean absolutely nothing to me   the graphics in wwf war zone are pretty good and original back in the day but who cares   it seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic and their movements true to life   who cares   when war zone first hit the scene in the late 90 's yeah the graphics were cool   not now especially when the only thing the wwe cares about these days is impressing gamers with realism you know wwf war zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new 3d level   a whole new level of crap   you see it makes me sick that the wwe wrestling games for 10 years now are all basically the same   let me explain why this is a bad thing you know when you buy an updated sports video game such as football or hockey and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names and maybe some new options here and there   that 's exactly what the wwe has done with their video games   for the last 10 years all the wwe games have been way too similar to each other and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years game it does n't matter if it 's smackdown smackdown 2 wwe raw for the xbox wwe wrestlemania for the gamecube etc   those games are all the same- a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism   i 'm all for realism but it does not matter in a wrestling game   a wrestling game is like any other video game in that it should be all about having fun with it   and i ca n't have fun with a wrestling game released today that more or less is exactly the same as a wrestling game from 10 years ago   it makes me sick to think 10 years later hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games before wwf war zone you had wwf in your house which to this day is a game that completely stands apart from other wwe wrestling games along with wwf wrestlemania the arcade game   before those games you had the button smashing delight of wwf raw on the super nes and sega genesis   once again the formula in those old school wrestling games did n't stick around and overstay its welcome   over 10 years with games just like wwf war zone is too much the very second wwf war zone came out on the playstation and n64 it all went wrong   game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games so from that point on all the wwe games had to be about having realistic looking gameplay and wrestler appearances and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach   it 's hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing   after a while you get sick of it wwf war zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights but it was the worst thing that could have happened   graphically wwf war zone is the first of its kind   being the first means it 's bound to have some flaws despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw   another major problem with the game is how slow it is   after the adrenaline rushing wwf in your house we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring very slowly   painfully slow in fact   going from wwf in your house to wwf war zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race   your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game   to be fair the only thing wwf wrestling games today have improved is the speed   everything else is the same as it was 10 years ago wwf war zone also started the popular create a wrestler mode   but it does n't matter because as i mention above wrestling games for 10 years have had that option   it 's an option that has lost its charm because of overkill and it 's time game companies got rid of it or did something to drastically change it   it was a fun and interesting idea at first but now 10 years later i do n't want to have it in a wrestling game ever again i tried getting rid of wwf war zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it so i had to get rid of it by throwing it away   no way was i keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with much more deserving playstation games if only wwe was more innovative with their wrestling games today instead of repeating the same formula every year i would n't have to keep going back and pointing out wwf war zone as the game where the downfall began   after 10 years updating the graphics and adding just a few new options and wrestlers does n't get the job done
this is my 400th review i really ca n't believe the past 3 or 4 years have gone by so quickly i mean almost 4 years ago i came on here started with video game reviews then i ranted on movies that i hate which turned into reviewing movies i love the 8 months on this account i have been reviewing old wrestling show i reviewed a lot of the old nwa wcw s pay per views i have just started with reviewing wwf ppv 's this past friday i reviewed survivor series 1995 i 'm going to review in your house 5 seasons beatings soon wwf warzone released inj july of 1998 for the playstaion nintendo 64 this game i feel gets undeserved flack it 's not as good as the thq games on the n64 like the wcw games or the 2 wwf games or any of the thq games on the playstion or ps2 but this game is better than most of the wrestling games put out by akklaim previously this game wwf attitude were the only good wrestling games put out by akklaim i have the playstaion version which was the version i played the most i bought it again recently cause my n64 does n't work anymore so getting into the game you have challenge mode which is a career mode where you go after the wwf intercontintal championship the wwf championship when you play through it you have wrestlers challenge you to a rematch it will be either a normal match a weapons match or a cage match thankfully when i as stone cold i did n't have to face ahmed cause the playstaion check out fun with ahmed on youtube if you do win the wwf title you can keep on defending it opponets become harder can evade your attacks then you have normal versus mode where you fight a random opponet the wrestlers you can play as are stone cold steve austin shawn michaels who retired for 4 years before this game came out due to a back injury ahmed johnson who left the wwf before this game came out the rock who was in between being rocky miavia the rock bret hart who as we all know was in wcw when the game came out but it is fun to play as bret hart the most easy wrestler to play as owen hart farooq goldust undertaker kane mankind ken shamrock the british bulldog who left the wwf in late 97 due to what happend in montereal mosh thrasher so this is more like the late 1997 roster but no wrestling game i 've played had a totally up to date roster you have tag team mode it would 've been nice if you could 've went for the wwf tag titles you have weapons match which is a no disqualification match cage match where you face an oppent in a steel cage match you just have to beat your oppent up until there health meter is in the red climb over it the nintendo 64 version had royal rumble gauntlet matches you have training mode where you can learn the moves come up with stradegy when you play as whoever you want the only problem is you ca n't do your finishing move in training mode look online how to do the finishing moves there not really that difficult to pull off you have create a wrestler mode back then it was neat now it 's just not that great but you can listen to the wrestlers enterance themes you can listen to them in the bio 's as well the playstaion version had the real themes while the 64 had chip tunes but they really were n't bad at all you have options mode where you can save the game adjust the difficulty set the time of the match you have the basement where all the unlockables are at if you want you have to play through on medium or hard with a certain wrestler to get stuff unlocked i enjoy playing through as austin bret hart is fun to play as cause of all the ways he has to work the legs i mean if you 're just getting started playing this game then guys like bret hart owen hart the british bulldog shawn michaels would be the best for beginners undertaker kane are also fun to play as there is an option where you can check your stats that shows how many wins losses you have i do like that if you or your opponet repeats the same move over over again the crowd will boo you but when you do different moves bigger moves then they will cheer you although i do n't think akklaim knows what a pump handle slam looks like cause a belly to back suplex is called in this game you get commentary by jim ross vince mcmahon warzone is a great game when you learn how to play it it is pretty fun the only problems i had was tag team mode feels like it 's broken at times like you partner will just stant there let the pin be broken sometimes the opponet wo n't break the pin let his partner be pinned i wish they would 've included the royal rumble in the playstion version more wrestlers could 've been put in the game the road warriors who returned to the wwf in 1997 guys like d'lo brown kama from the nation of domination i wish brian pillman could 've been put in the game if i ever get wwf attitude then i 'll review it
when i first got this game i found it to be boring not too soon after getting it when i play it today i still think it 's boring wwf war zone is the first real wwf wrestling game to be released on the playstation i do n't really consider the in your house game to be wrestling wise but more mortal kombat like war zone is based off the wwf roster from late 1997 to early 1998 featuring only the most popular stars in the game among the wrestlers in this game you can choose to play as stone cold steve austin shawn michaels bret hart the undertaker the rock triple h mankind goldust owen hart ahmed johnson farrooq british bulldog ken shamrock and the headbangers the opening of the game is cool as you 're given a raw like intro that used to open monday night raw back in the mid to late 90s from there on you 're taken to the menu screen that 's in the form of an elevator in the menu you can look at the wrestlers biographies that let you listen to their theme and see their attires they wear in the game there 's also a training mode on the menu that lets you pick a wrestler and learn how to perform their moves before you go into the game once you enter the game you can either play exhibition matches to get adjusted to everything or go straight to challenge mode among the match types available are singles tag team tornado tag team hardcore or steel cage the steel cage match is probably the most frustrating match to play when you climb the cage i did n't know what button to push to climb down i pushed down but i just ended up climbing back down to the ring i lost most of the cage matches challenge mode involves you choosing a superstar to play as and guide them to the world championship unfortunately this was a boring and irritating mode to play once you play one match you 've played them all you have to fight the same opponents at least 4 or 5 times before you advance to newer ones as you progress through you 'll be met by a woman in a limo in the parking lot who will either show interest you for winning a match or insult you for losing a match oh yeah that 's another thing if you lose 1 or 2 matches you 're automatically sent back to the beginning and have to start over from match 1 to go up it ultimately screws you over and you 're forced to play a lot of the same boring matches again overall i found war zone boring then and i find it boring now in my opinion in your house is more fun to play than this even the sequel game to war zone attitude is more fun to play than war zone so if you do n't want to be bored skip war zone and buy in your house or attitude instead
i enjoy the shows and ppvs this one is a great one to get if you like wwf wrestling
this wwf game sucks ... boring ... graphics are alright ... it was just plain awful even for it 's time!ugh this game was slo ... get this game .. get no mercy   best wwf game ever! ... this game was very dull and boring ... if i could give it a zero i would ... this game flat out sucks!good thing i baught this for a 2 bucks .... but still that was a waste ... later
use to play this as a kid and when i played it it brought back all kinds of memories from my childhood definitely a game to have if you are or were a fan of wrestling
i played this game a lot when i was little it was always fun and i enjoyed it the music in the background the colors the graphics its all great the coolest thing is that this game is one of a kind and it is really a good one to add to any nintendo 64 collection gameplay is easy and overall a really awesome game
this was n't widely released in america though those who have played it swear by it as being just as fun as mario kart 64 i agree with this comparison however this has some fun twists that mario kart 64 lacks one such twist is that laps occur when you get to the bottom of the hill and jump back on the lift this can cause for some hilarious chaos if two racers have a good lead on opponents but are trying to bump each other out of the way to jump on the next lift chair it can give other people a chance to catch up and possibly sneak onto a chair first if their opponents knocked each other over i love this dynamic because it makes it more than just your average mario kart racing clone other features include the ability to buy new boards and perform aerial trick to earn extra cash money earned during a race can also be used to buy weapon items encased in boxes littered throughout a course i also ought to mention the music it 's wonderful it features bubbley techno music reminiscent of dance pop groups like aqua you 'll dig the energy the music provides if you are a fan of mario kart 64 style crossfires i think you 'll find this is a unique addition to your n64 collection
snowboarding games are a dime a dozen these days so it 's nice when a good one comes along although it 's rare to see a snowboarding game play out like mario kart it makes for a really fun game you play as one of 6 grade school children collect items and weapons knock off enemies with these items and weapons do tricks and get money while trying to win the race even though the childish characters may intimidate many who see this game this still is a great game the game looks pretty nice for n64 standards the controls are tight the sounds are good and the music is very catchy this game also uses great ideas such as saving money to upgrade your snowboard or playing on really wacky but really enjoyable courses in fact some of the courses have no snow on them but that 's the fun of this game getting to snowboard down unimaginable terrain while at the same time hitting your opponents with pie pans bombs rocks and other items it releases some kind of childhood glee deep in your brain that i just ca n't explain but it 's not all fun and games though there are some problems first is the game 's image many are really going to be turned off by the childish nature of this game though i liked it so much i did n't care the biggest problem is that you need a conroller pak to save your data the real gripes here is that there is no battery backed memory option along with the controller pak use and since the game requires 121 of the 123 pages in the controller pak you 'll need to spend more money getting more controller paks if you have other games that require it also mystical ninja starring goemon rugrats in paris or games where you want to save data for safe keeping wave race 64 perfect dark but even with these issues the game is still really fun and worth playing if you like it and still want more try its sequel snowboard kids 2 but try the original first to see if you like the style of play i 'll bet dollars to donuts that you 'll enjoy it though great job atlus
i liked all of the tricks you can play being a kid i like being a kid rather than an adult sometimes the boards look cool
if you like mario kart 64 then you will absolutely love this game its sort of a rendition of mario kart 64 but instead of riding karts your riding snowboards now in my biased opinion i love snowboarding games and this one was a classic among my friends and me i recently played it again and noticed several pros and cons that made it such a good game it had hilarious sound effects great controls a few varieties of boards to chose from and solid looking graphics it is also fun to get power ups and shoot down your friends to get in the lead what 's really cool about this game is the chair lift at the end of the run to get back to the top of the mountain you have to go up a chairlift but the chaos that happens to be the first person to ride the chairlift is hilarious the only thing that turns people off from the game is that there are only four riders to choose from and they 're all little kids in other games like mario kart there is more characters to chose from but the character choices are only a minor con it also has an incredibly babyish look towards it that can be a slight turn off for older kids   but once you can read past its cover the game can be so much fun to play with friends and family it is almost nothing like the immature style the game gives off overall i rate this game a solid 4.5 out of 5 because it is fun and exciting and in my opinion better than mario kart 64
getting this game would be a waste of time and money   for halfthe price of this i 'd rather get a game that offers better graphics better realism and better everything   if you have n't already guessed it 's red alert   even though it looks pretty good after about a week you wo n't want to play it anymore   with red alert i continually go back to try just one more strategy ... i think they just sat down and set a deadline for this game and the guys making it waited until the last week to do it   right now all you need to do is type in the search box up there quot;red alert&quot and buy that game ... you will have a way better game and not spend as much
i have to admit something i love the way this game looks   it is spectacular in the graphics sense but the story just left me out to dry   the orginal command and conquer storyline was way better   the gdi missions   are a joke in this game and i have to say it ... nod rulez   the nod missions   are very fun to look at and play especially the evil hal computer that   talks to you in the cool voice   the game play units are completely   unbalanced   on gdi side all you have to do is amass a huge army of tank   mechs and you can destroy any base no matter how fortified it is   on the   nod side amass a huge army of 30 mobile artillery and nobody can stand in   your way   the game is worth buying to see how it looks but the gameplay   is horrible and some of the missions are close to impossible which may   frustrate some novice players   ok westwood you have provided the   interface now quit slacking and give us a good story
tiberian sun is an example of how a real time game should be   great campains where you can be either nod or gdi   this game also has great skrimishes   where you can play the computer on a diffrent level of   difficulty and can play anwhere from 1 7 enimies   with alot of diffrent   units and buildings this game is not to be missed
this was the first c&amp;c game i ever purchased i got this game when i was n't playing much else apart from everquest upon a friends recommendation i was n't to familiar with the c&amp;c franchise of rts games from westwood now i am a fan of the series if you do n't know tiberian sun is a rts about two military forces at odds with one another the evil nod that wants to rule the world while the honorable gdi wants to protect the world the single player missions are on two discs one is gdi and the other disc is the nod single player missions both are quite fun and it helps you to learn the gameplay i ca n't say i liked the full motion video sequences but they are quite funny in an unintentional way!the online multiplayer is where the real fun of tiberian sun is at there just is no way to describe winning a long 2 hour match online and not getting booted off!this is a good value for the money it may not be as great as age of empires or starcraft but tiberian sun is fun nonetheless enjoy
loved it one of the best games in this genre good story and even has the guy from the first terminator who protects the woman ca n't think of his name as one of the main actors in the cutscenes and james earl jones high production values   the game play is top notch
unless you intend to cheat and mod the game do n't waste your money uneven gameplay and few options plague this game it is also way too short even at this reduced price spend your money on a game just not this one hope this helps i hate to have games collecting dust but this is one of those and i own about 50 recent games so i know what 's what
i am writing this review from what i thought of it before red alert 2 came out   this is a great game with a pretty good story line though it lacks graphics   westwood online the multiplayer sever is also very good   if your lookign to buy a good rts i recomend red alert 2 but if you do n't want to spend the money on ra@ this is still a great game
i thought red alert was a pretty fun game this was just a clone of red alert though the people that make c&amp;c need to come up with some more ideas all the c&amp;c games are exactly the same i did n't like red alert to start with so tiberian sun has to be worse
all right the graphics are nice and the terrain damage is something new but that does n't make up for the gameplay which could be summed up in one word slow.skirmishes take a real long time to get going i mean at least a half an hour before you can get a sizeable force and then what do you find yourself doing protecting your base with them and attacking with missle launches i 'm dead serious the only way to attack is with missle launches to attack with your men especially tanks takes like ten minutes to even get to the enemy base!that being said the multiplayer is a total waste of time if the person your playing saves you the trouble of teching and attacks you early on with engineers consider yourself lucky do n't get caught up in a 3 hour game that is just about to be resolved when you or your opponent loses his her connection and do n't consider engineering a cheap way to attack it 's the only way anyone attacks ... the campaign is allright i guess if you can stand the poor gameplay to get from cutscene to cutscene which are n't as good as red alerts were ..... come on you ca n't tell me nod does n't have a huge advantage over gdi they do let 's hope kane bites the dust soon before the c&amp;c series turns as twisted as quot;the forgotten&quot
unfortunately this game is just a hodge podge of elements from the other games   there are some interesting new units and i did enjoy the much larger maps   my biggest complaint is that it is so short   you are just getting to use some of the more advanced units and the game is over   you never get the big final battle like at the end of the last two incarnations   this is by far the shortest game of the bunch   i finished each side 's campaign over the course of three nights about 9 12 hours of game play
well it seems that those idiots who gave ts a low rating was because they   thought ts reused red alerts units that is completely wrong ts is set in   a futuristic world with advanced units red alert was a prequel to the   original c&amp;c and was set throughout the cold war ts does not use   standard tanks and the new units were made as it would have been seen in   the year ts took place which was 2030 this is especially true with gdi and   there titans disruptors firestrom defense rpg towers mmk ii and a whole   lot more nod has has the cyborgs underground units and and the banshee   aircraft etc now are these the same units from ra i do nt think so   westwood retained a couple of units from the original c&amp;c such as the   devil 's tougue and light tank but they upgraded the functions of these   units to please gamers nothing from this game was copied from ra- trust   me as for starcraft some say its better than ts and some say it is nt i   personally hate that game its way more complex to understand than ts   simple interface no deformidable terrain you have to right click to   deselect units very awkward structures take extremely long to build as   well as units those same structures look like they have legs(terran   barracks and engineering bay i also have no idea what the storyline is   about no real actors jus   bad fmvs).i could name a whole lot more but it   would take up too much space in this review the only single thing i like   is the marine responses which give u a good laugh now and then but it still   gets repetitive after a while which is common in almost all rts games   sure starcraft is an original game with new features that pleases people   just like the old c&amp;c. some people ask for too much in a sequel and   when they find what they have nt been looking for they disgrace the game   we 'll see what sequel is in store for starcraft but for now if you re a   serious fan of c&amp;c 's then pick up a copy of ts- you 'll find an   intersting game with a whole bunch of new features including some old time   favs that would have remembered
okay i admit it the two main reasons i bought this game are james earl   jones and michael biehn whom i believe are bloody great however the game   in itself is lots of fun i 'm making my way through the gdi games at the   moment and having a good time
this is this is the first strategy game i have ever liked that i played so maybe i 'm partial to it ... but i love it   i do n't understand why some   people are so crushed when their quot;favorite&quot game series puts out   a bad game   it 's not that big of a deal   for all you red alert buffs red   alert 2 will be out soon so chill out for a minute   there are a ton of   different strategies to play this game with so it becomes extremely   addictive   once you get the basics down ... the sky is pretty much the   limit on strategies you can use so this adds replay value to the game   it   will definitely keep you busy until the next installment by westwood   the   online play is great and easy to use   i have n't even played the single   player game because i just ca n't get enough of the online play   so unlike   the other people who are saying they hate it but they probably still play   it often i like it an awful lot
i just do n't understand those who want to give this game low marks this is a game that when modified with the numerous free online downloads is as good a game as any out there to start this game is a sequel to command and conquer not red alert which is the much more popular westwood game that was a problem for some who just assumed that westwood would come out with a red alert sequel first never the less there are features in this game that improve upon the original the original cnc did not allow for skirmish play against the al opponent only missions this game does allow multiplayer play and the al is very   competitive at the more difficult levels   there are some other small extras as well such as more colors to choose from and the oppportunity to make a map right at the game menu just set your specifications and it makes a map that 's meets those specs one new feature i love is the option for a deployable mcv this allows you to start a base and then move your command center to another area this game is also much more strategic then the originas cnc. the maps are spectacular with many cliffs ridges and rivers and lakes no game has better maps and terrain i wish i could say the same about the units though while the structures are creative and attractive the units look down right bizarre and cartoonish some may like this but i do n't the colors of the units and structures are rich and   pleasant but some units are too strange looking to enjoy the infantry look alright but the tanks take some getting used to another unfortunate aspect of the game is that the nod is given the more strategic interesting units the gdi has more size and firpower while the nod is more sneaky with it 's burrowing apcs and missles one feature i like is the infantryman the disc throwers for the gdi or the rocket guys for the nod have armor that makes them much more competitive in battles than a rocket guy or grenade guy in red alert you ca n't just run over these infantrymen a group of 10 disc throwers can do serious damage to a camp if allowed to sneak in or they can quickly do away with a harvester the basic play is bascially the same as cnc or red alert but there are enough new features here to make it a worthwhile purchase at 20.overall i would rate the stock tiberian game that comes from the store as a 3.7 to 3.8 stars a good solid game what makes this a truly great game is the numerous free downloads and upgrades available both at westwood.com and many other sites on the program menu for the game is an upgrade option from westwood that helps to work out some of the bugs and improves the game in addition there are literally dozens of web sites devoted entirely or in part to this game that provides an incredible array of free downloads that provide game modifications new maps units and game tips ect also included are opportunites to join klans and clubs things that really enhance the enjoyment of the game one download called quot;resistance 2.0&quot will add 50 more speed and firepower and will double the number of units and structures you can find this download at tsden.com it is these additional modifications and options that convert a good game into a fantastic game these upgrades and downloads are absolutely free and require very little time effort or computer savyness to add and if you 're ambitious you can do your own modifications the only complaint i would have of my modified game is that there is no navy all these wonderful maps with water but no opportunity to make destroyers or crusiers like in red alert or total annililation .................. socks
this pretty good it has a good story great in game movies and adequate gameplay however most of the marketing for this game has centered around it being a sequel to red alert this is simply not true the two games have   almost nothing in common and red alert is a far better game in saying this   i mean that tiberian sun takes a huge step backwards in terms of gameplay   from red alert gone are the ships and air planes to be replaced by boring   helicopters and cheap quot;hover units&quot;.however this game is   not a total waste it has a very good storyline and execellent cinematics   featuring performances by several hollywood stars well maybe not stars but   close enough the graphics are pretty good but other games have done   better sure it 's a classic and if you really like the series go   ahead and buy it but if you want the true best strategy game of 1999 go   and check out homeworld it 's a far better game
when i first got the game it was quot;wow&quot thinking it would be the best   i have to admit it is better than some games i have already played but it just did n't have the zing of the other c&amp;c games the computer stinks   i could beat them playing as gdi(good guys which is hard because nod(bad guys has all the best vehicles units and structures   i love the missile silo   talk about blitzcrieg on your opponent   if you want to have about a 65 chance of winning stick with nod.i would n't recommend the missions because they are all too easy or all too hard   i stick to skirmish and internet games myself i might venture to say that it is worth an inexpencive look   maybe even borrowing it from a friend all in all i would have to say that the graphics are superb stories are bad   sound is so so and gameplay is dependant on which side you choose(nod being better
remember command and conquer the real time strategy that lets you build a base a lot of units and rush the opposing force   you 'd think the developers of the original would come up with some innovative game play for the sequel while maybe they can they did n't here not only is the game play unchanged it suffers from a weak story poor balancing and computer ai and several small problems the single player campaign story what there is of it is just a jumble of scenarios without much to tie them together there are characters and things happen to them but but there is n't a story progression to follow you fight over here you fight over there then it 's the final battle in fact i reached the end of the gdi campaign without realizing it the live video cut scenes should have helped create a rich back story but writing this i ca n't remember any of it there are balance issues particularly with nod units and structures a nod super laser structure can destroy almost anything with one shot but the nod artillery is completely unbalanced with a long range and a big punch the artillery is can wipe out any ground force and is unstoppable even in small numbers as long as a small anti air backup is nearby the computer is an easy opponent it does n't rush but sending units at piecemeal a handful at a time it does n't protect it 's harvesters either once you locate them it 's easy to cut off the computer 's resources the computer showed some initiative just once during a nod scenario several gdi engineers rushed my base taking several of my structures i was so surprised it nearly wiped me out but building a good perimeter stopped later rushes in the scenarios that followed the engineer rush never happened again i did n't try any higher difficulty levels maybe the computer plays better there large maps are hard to manage the game tell you that an offscreen unit is lost but not where the unit is some scenarios seem designed to simply frustrate you with a huge map and a timed objective with no direction as to where to accomplish it in the end the game is all about the mass rush once you build 50 or medium strength units nothing the computer ca n't stop you on the technical side this game ran perfectly on windows 2000.if you 're looking for more of the original command and conquer this game 's for you
final fantasy 7 is the best ff i have yet to play   i have played 8 and 9 also but 7 has the best music battle system and junctioning system of all of them not to mention the greatest story line in the history of everything   besides a couple of translation errors this game is perfect   i was introduced to final fantasy 7 3 years ago and i still do not know many things about it so if your looking for a long challenge ahead of you but not a challenge so hard that it sucks the fun out of it you should buy this game and before they stop selling it
i have always been a ff fan ever since 2 was out i 've been loving it ever since and was glad that i played this let me tell you about the game as you have probably found out from other reviews it is about a rebel orginization named avalanche who is saving the planet from shinra inc. who is polluting the earth one of these members is a man named cloud a 21 year old guy who was in a orginazation called soldier which is the army of shinra possibly the greatest plot and climax i 've ever seen great battles they proved to be a challenge cloud sid and red 13 are my favorite charecters also some of the best movies in a game that i 've seen for a long time espeically the 11 minute ending man that was good enjoy
in this world nothing is as it seems   no one is who they say they are and surprises lurk around every corner   this is a wonderful game with a rich story great side quests and great animation   the evil shin ra corporation has been mining mako an energy source that is the lifeforce of the earth itself   avalanche is an underground resistance group headed by barret a man who 's arm was lost in an explosion at a mako refinery   cloud is a mercenary who used to work for soldier shin ra 's private army   sephiroth is a great warrior for soldier who has been lost for many years   now cloud is working with avalanche and sephiroth has resurfaced but he is now an insane powerhungry man with a desire to use black materia to summon a meteor to destroy the world   materia are energy sources used in weapons to add skills to the user   this game has a great story and a great battle engine where you can customize 9 different characters with different materia   this is a long game but it is legendary
final fantasy 7 is yet another gold brick in the shimmering castle of squaresofts frequent triumphs you will fall in love with the characters you 'll wish you could jump right into the world the game 's events are structured very well(except for the ever present level up before the final boss stage of the game the graphics are wonderful in their own right it 's just as deep and enthralling as any final fantasy should be but to be honest it 's a hassle to bother with the pc version it 's best to get a playstation and play it that way ff7 's system requirements are strict and tend to make the game look and run worse than on the playstation even if you have a good computer and keyboard control is no fun at all(ironically i used a gamepad that resembles the ps controller and otherwise this is a striaght port so you 're not missing anything if you go for the ps version but if you refuse to can't buy a playstation this version is better than nothing and you certainly wo n't want to miss out
ff 7 has always been my favorite game in the whole world in fact it is my whole world   i play it everyday but i was always sad because i had to leave the playstation to go on the internet to read about and discuss ff 7   but not anymore   now ff 7 is out on the pc and you have to buy it at any cost so that you can laugh and cry and live the greatest experience of all time the experience that is final fantasy 7 on your computer   just thinking about it is making me tear up a little   i promise you will not be disappointed   the stunning gut wrenching visuals the passionate heart wrenching storyline the exciting ball wrenching combat system the absolutely awe inspiring characters ... nothing could be more perfect   you have not lived if you have not played this game
this rpg is a blast to play   the graphics and battle system will blow you away when you first play it   there 's even a tutorial so you can get in the game quicker   as for the storyline excellent   the storyline goes all over the place but that 's what fun about it   the game itself is also long and entertaining   it took me 73 hours to finish side quests and all   you even get an amusement park filled with games and wonderful items to help you on your quest   get this game   it will get you hoooked on hours to come
i 've never played the playstation version of this game and this was my   first time playing any sort of final fantasy game   i originally purchased   it to watch the computer animation but quickly fell in love with the world   the characters and the dozens of things to do you start off playing   cloud or whatever you decide to name him and are an ex soldier now   fighting for a group called avalanche who want to shut down a company   called shinra because they 're using mako energy to power the city   mako   energy is the life energy of every living thing on the planet and once its   used up the planet will die   from there you 're quickly plunged into a   story about love betrayal duty and saving the world i easily got 40   hours of gameplay and the story blew me away   every time yu think you know   what 's going on another clue pops up and blows everything else away   there 's an even balance between combat and actual rpg where you talk to   folks in towns this game also has great replayibility with dozens of   sub quests and side games to keep you busy   can you raise a gold chocobo   can you defeat all three weapons   can you find all the mega elixers   can   you gain the secret characters   can you find everyone 's super technique   and ultimate weapons?the story was amazingly detailed the characters   were all unique and the game pulled no punches   i highly reccomend it
the game works well on you computer   i downloaded it from sqaureenix and love it i could not download this copy however since i have windows 8 and could not find any type of patch for the midi files   someone of better computer experience may be able to do it
this game is fantastic and you wo nt be able to put it down for a long long time   i have over 120 hours played on my game save   final fantasy vii platinum edition features a revamped old soundtrack ... that i find 2x better than the psone version 's soundtrack   although it takes a while to adjust to the numpad controls after playing for a while you 'll wonder how you would have done it any other way   the on screen controls are bizarre and during scenes such as the timed puzzle in the rocket ship you 'll have a hard time typing in key combos   materia allows you to use different magics on different characters allowing for different characters to use summons magic and cure   my tip do nt give up solely because of the controls --- this game is fantastic and although i found the console experience more enthralling and easier to jump into the pc version was much more cinematic and was totally worth it   ff7 is by far the best game i have ever played and you do not want to miss out on this adventure   my only tip do nt save over the same file especially before you enter the northern crater -- you wo nt be able to exit it if you do replayability tons of extra caves quests missions mini games to find extra materia weapons limit breaks and bosses to fight well after the game is over.)gameplay amazing boss fights you will be on the edge of your seat during battles incredibly fun)story the plot twists the depth in the story the emotions ... its amazing)graphics you can view on a big resolution better textures and stuff   more crisp than the psone version)controls takes a while to get used to you wo nt want to try another control setup once you do)sound sound effects are recycled from the psone game but the music was totally redone and that is one of the biggest parts of this game)addictiveness i stopped playing my other games for almost 4 months when i got into this game)the best part of this game is that it is so easy to pick up and play   the ruby and emerald weapons provide you with more challenge than the last boss of the game   raising chocobos and minigames at the golden saucer could nt be more fun and this remains the only game besides world of warcraft that i have nt uninstalled from my computer   final fantasy vii is a keeper and do nt be discouraged by the prices on amazon by the time you 're done with the game you will believe it to be the best 50 you have spent on a game   i would know because i said the same thing
this game is awesome but see my playstation reveiw for results
it is a fun game the first time around and it still is having some problems with the movies running on my computer ronna c.
this final fantasy 7 is one of the most influenced games of all time the fan bases for this one game blows out all ff fan base out of the water never has any other ff game seen such an influenced with multiple related games story characters found in different games multiple movies toys cards etc based on this game   why was that all necessary for this one game?it 's just that damn awesome this game has everything story characters battle system music humor and more if it did n't why else did this game influenced so many other things that followed it after because it was just damn awesome!you can play this game over and over before getting tried of it but you will keep it in your hearts forever the amazing game play the amazing characters and amazing graphics back in those days.)they just ca n't make anything that even comes close to what they did back then i wish they did but they ca n't it was just too well done lol
i 'll preface this by saying yes i have played through ffvii on the playstation when it first came out i 've probably played through it at least a dozen times as i just enjoy the story how it unfolds the characters you meet and the events that transpire that intertwines their stories together prior to this game i was mostly into sports fps type games an rpg heck i did n't even know what that meant at the time game was not even remotely on my list of games that were coming out that i wanted a friend of mine where i was working at showed me a gamer mag that had a full rundown of this game indeed it seemed very impressive and the more he talked about it the more i got interested in it then came release day i still was n't sold on it but after leaving work i figured ... what the hell drove 45 minutes north to the nearest mall where a buddy mine worked at ebgames soon as i entered he was like did you preorder this i told him no and that i was n't really interested in rpg 's as they always sound boring and i 'd lose interest quick and waste my money he showed me a quick demo and i admit it got me thinking as to i wonder what happens after this ... i finally said sure he hooked me up with the strategy guide free tshirt and the 3 disc game ... 3 discs when i cracked open the case and saw 3 discs ... i knew this would be an epic legendary tale i just did n't know how epic i wo n't go much into the characters as they have been around a long time and most know who what they are but the story ... wow i could not have been more hooked at first it started off a little slow mostly to get you introduced to the characters and get some backstory going after the 2nd mako reactor explosion and you get knocked into slums and fall through the church and meet aeris ... it all changes the direction tone and emotion starts running higher battles get more intense you really get the feel that something big much bigger than even all these characters is building up it all seems to point to shinra but even as you infiltrate it something is even more disturbing jenova soon as i saw that short cutscene with cloud peeking inside its stasis chamber .. my jaw dropped i wanted to know what it is where it came from what they are using it for etc etc etc but that s what set this game apart the more answers you get the more questions were raised than before the world is huge lots of explorable areas with side quests and storylines i spent alot of time raising the chocobos and racing them to get the gold choco so i can access the caves that contained important and powerful items and materia materia system one of the best magic systems i have encountered to date while you wo n't use all the materia you buy find its the reward of seeing that glowing green blue red yellow purple stone that makes you fight to get it and see what it is summons are excellent with great animation for the time it was made knights of the round was very long to summon but the damage and wait is well worth it characters some of the most diverse ever seen and very deep with different backgrounds i think the first time i really got a sense of how immense this story was getting was when i first went into shinra mansion with all the creepy creatures you fight and head into the basement where all the shinra research was stored regarding jenova sephiroth and the experiments the characters sucked you in with their drive and emotion to the situations making you want to keep going and see what s around the next corner in conclusion for us long timers here this game never gets old for the newcomers get ready to experience something extraordinary to quote the back of the playstation case .. what erupts goes beyond imagintion
an interesting aspect of the final fantasy series was that all of the games were essentially an experiment the first game was the ultimate experiment will this game succeed or will square go under but each game was a stage in development ff- choosing party and character sprites in battle(before that the dragon warrior games had battle head on)ffii- wound developable characters(romancing saga later employed this when you survive near death your hp goes up when you fight alot attack goes up etc.)ff3j- simple job system completely changes characters no permanent skills)ff4- changing characters a dark knight becomes a paladin)ffv- advanced job system level up with one of the non command skills to default class and you permanently learn it for instance the run skill you can learn from the thief and then de equip it)ffvi- basic gf system mainly just boosts skills)ff7- basic weapon systemff8- gf systemff9- i heard it had some sort of advanced weapon system where different weapons learn different magic never bought the gamelikewise the plot in each was experimental they fiddled around with the crystal concept in ff1 ff3j ff4 ffv   they had ruthless kings dark overlords and the occasional malicious squid but the most intense game i have played so far was final fantasy 7 why well when halfway through the game your character does n't even know who he is anymore it is pretty interesting   not to mention you have combos to build chocobos to raise and race never was good at this and some pretty weird items to collect i mean honestly what other game has you give some girl digestant in exchange for perfume and a dress for your male character to wear
words really can describe how wonderful this game is the first thing you will notice is the incredible graphics note a 3d card is not required everything is drawn in great detail right down to character traits and facial expressions who would have thought a fleshless person would be so good with expressions the story is also very entertaining and added with the graphics it makes this a very absorbing adventure this is one of the few games that i ca n't say anything negative about this is a must have
grim fandango will definitally be enjoyed by fans of film noir and mexican mythology i 'd give it a 4 and a half if i could the graphics have their flaws and the game runs choppy on systems not far ahead of the system requirements some of the puzzles are utterly impossible to figure out without incredible luck or the aid of a stradegy guide but the game is truly astonishing you follow the character manny calavera a travel agent for the dead guiding souls to their final resting place in the best way possible for some reason manny is denied any premium clients who s behind all this find out over a 4 year journey from the dusty streets of el marrow to the edge of the world and back again absolutely beautiful backgrounds and film noir ish music immerse you in the atmosphere clever interface and variable controls are great a very involving game not too long not too short humor and wit are weaved through every scene in conclusion film noir style surreal visuals toe tapping and ensuing music gripping story charming characters and challenging puzzles will intrigue all game fans
i had problems with it at first crashing but then i installed the patch that i downloaded and it worked great the game did remind me a lot of the monkey island series although monkey island i 'd say had the best music grim had ok music game was funny and at the end i wanted more- i finished it too fast i should n't have used those cheats really recommended i wish there was a part ii
this was truly one of the best games i have played in a long time it has challenging puzzles that may at times seem impossible but the solution is often right before your eyes based upon the mexican day of the dead it   gives the player a little bit of background while keeping them entertained   great game lots of p.i. cliches mentally stimulating and just plain fun
not a whole lot to say except that as far as adventure games go this is   the standard that all others should try to exceed outstanding voice   acting and scripting hilarious game without making fun of itself tough   but logical puzzles that will have you scratching your head beautiful and   original storyline movie material right here this is what adventure   gaming was fated for
i was very dubious when i started playing grim fandango   an adventure game with polygons   and the scumm menu interface system that was in every single past lucasarts adventure game was gone   but i gave it a try   thank   goodness i did grim fandango is a story about manny calavera a travel   agent for the souls of the dead   he sells packages to the departed for   their four year journey to their just rewards and if he sells enough he   can earn enough to make his own trip someday imagine the theme of   casablanca with some mexican folklore and mayan art thrown in for fun   add   big orange demons hot rods killer beavers cat races and the grim reaper   and you have grim fandango the story is supurb and the voice acting was   top notch   it 's very difficult to do a dramatic yet humorous story but   somehow this game pulls it off   grim fandango could yank me to the brink   of tears one moment and cause me to almost bust a gut another the things   that make a good adventure game are all there   logical puzzles that do n't   cause your gameplay to come to a standstill until you solve them good   acting good animation and good code   if i were ever forced to reccomend   only on adventure game to someone this would be it
this is without a doubt one of the best games ever made adventure or otherwise it is fun amusing original colorful and challenging without being annoying the only games that came close to it may be the monkey island series or the last express the game is beautifully designed with unforgettable characters amazing landscapes and reminds me of being inside a really well written movie sadly lucasarts stopped making games like this a loss for the world
the game 's okay although i do n't think making the charactersin 3d was a very good idea plus at some points game gets outrightboring and all the main characters smoke ...   although the game will crash sometimes and it might get stuck overall the game is pretty much okay if you do n't count crashes and how the characters act and look ...   end
if they made more games like this i 'd be a pauper intelligent funny easy to use easy to solve and no bloody chess problems it 's also thought provoking gorgeous well written and as believable as talking skeletons and elevator demons can make it one of my favorites that i play over and over again one caveat at least one puzzle seems to be tied to processor speed so if you have a fast machine you 'll need to download a patch from the manufacturers website well worth the trouble though
this is the epitome of graphic adventures no other game has even come close to grim fantango when it comes to humor of all shades and shapes inventiveness delicious irony creative graphics and plain good ol fun!!this is a 10-year old game mind you yet it retains its freshness as any true work of art this is how computer games should have been and not the pathetic cookie cutter products of mega corporations working in tandem with gx card companies ... your character hilarious and lovable manny calavera is already ... dead when you start in fact he has been dead for some time stuck in limbo trying to pay his way to a better afterlife by selling tickets to other souls on their way to paradise guess what corruption is not limited just to this world and where there is corruption there is oppression and where there is oppression there is always a revolution brewing ... realizing he is being duped manny reluctantly joins the afterlife underground and takes us in a tour de force of one of the most beautiful game ever produced immersing noirish atmosphere detailed art deco settings fast bogartian dialogs with a subtle ironic frosting warning there are known problems with today 's faster processors so unless you have a really old system running win98 you will need the winxp patch otherwise you will not get past the crane scene).with the highest recommendations
i still remember when i first bought this game in the 90 's and i still playthe game from time to time for both entertainment and nostalgia   as with most of the pc games in the 90 's there was no type commands but just the point and click with the mouse usually but still the humor and video cut scenes in the game were more than enough to keep you playing until the end   the short story plot was your character was a civil servant for the spiritual plane where the recently departed had to stop before making their final passage to eternal rest   your character for whatever reason had to work off a certain amount of time to clear his debt before going to the place of eternal rest as well   the job was you worked to see how well the person who just died was in life meaning the more compassionate and humane they were in life the faster to paradise they would get to meaning the usual ways to get to paradise depending on the person was bus boat car and if very high on the morality meter the number nine train which would only take nine minutes for the person to get to paradise   of course there was more to the game and that is why it made it very entertaining to play   the video graphics are of the 90 's era so again if your used to playing recent pc games you might feel the graphics are sub par but do n't let that dissuade you from this game   the voice actors they got to do the characters were incredible both in their acting for their characters and their ability to bring the humor and excitement into the game itself   i know while some think this does n't have the fighting or the action of recent pc games but i still feel that it 's one of the few classics that many people will still find very enjoyable to play both for themselves and children without worrying about to much violence of the game
grim fandango is best described as a detective story in the film noir tradition   the hero of the piece manny calavera evokes the private eye of the 1940 's or 50 's melodrama whose story begins with a dame walking   into his office and who quickly finds himself enmeshed in a vast and   corrupt conspiracy which may do him in the difference here is that at the   beginning of this story manny is already dead and the events transpire in   the land of the dead the place where according to mexican folklore   departed souls go to embark on their journey to the hereafter blending   mexican folk mythology with the film noir genre grim fandango is   ultimately respectful of both traditions and the striking art design is in   keeping with this approach combining art deco and pre columbian elements   the dialogue refreshingly witty and literate draws the player in to the   characters and the story as does the varied musical score which includes   mexican folk melodies the characters are for the most part vividly   drawn and due to the superb performances by the voice talent particularly   tony plana as manny and maria canals as meche are fresh despite their   mostly formula roles one character which may provoke mixed reactions is   that of glottis manny 's driver a cartoonish jar jar binks like figure   glottis skews the story in a younger direction at odds with the mild   epithets employed by other characters in a few instances and while my   children liked glottis i expect most players will find him either   endearing or irritating the interface in this game is unusual rather   than pointing and clicking with a mouse the player controls manny 's   movements with the arrow keys waiting to see manny 's head turn to an   object he becomes interested in and clicking quot;enter&quot to see what   happens this approach takes some getting used to and can be cumbersome at   times but it places manny at the center of the action and increases the   player 's identification with manny ultimately serving the story the   puzzles many of which are multi step involve crafting rube goldberg   solutions to various problems some of the solutions are thoroughly   counterintuitive i wo n't give anything away but let 's just say that   objects such as balloons or a crystal paperweight are employed in bizarre   ways and are best solved through aggressive trial and error   clues may   pop up from time to time to expedite this sometimes tedious process that   aside the lucasarts team especially writer tim schafer deserve high   praise for this highly original and literate adventure
if you liked full trottle and love lucasarts games in general you 'll love this game it 's one of the funniest games i 've ever played the way all the charters talk hispanic is enough to me laugh out loud manny   calavera is the most likeable anit hero you 'll ever have the pleasure to   control in this fantastic land of the dead adventure game who said the   adventure games was dead grim fandango proofs them all wrong ...
i do n't go for adventure games personally   ninety percent of the time i prefer shooters   but this one ... man it 's so weird so unique and so genius through and through how can you not love it?here 's the story   manny calavera is a low level salesman trying to earn an honest commission and make a decent day 's pay but it never seems to work out for him   his boss is constantly on his back he 's routinely snaked by a competitor domino hurley and the right sales never come his way   it 's a lousy life to have especially if you 're already dead that 's the twist manny and just about everyone else in the game is dead   this whole game takes place in the land of the dead of mexican aztec folklore with a strong art deco influence with heavy doses of 30s crime noir thrown in   everyone in the game is fashioned to look like the sugar skeletons used in day of the dead festivals called calaveras get it?).manny works in the department of death trying to work off his time for his misdeeds when he was alive   he does that by trying to sell travel packages to the recently deceased so they can make their four year journey across the land of the dead until they reach the portal leading to the land of eternal rest   the quality of life this person lived determines whether they get to use a car a luxury liner or the exclusive no 9 train which speeds its passengers there in four minutes instead of the customary four years unfortunately the kind of lowlifes who keep coming manny 's way only deserve walking sticks at best which does absolutely nothing to help manny work off his time   so he decides to take matters into his own hands and steal the right kind of client and that 's when he gets in over his head the story is pure crime noir with a technicolor twist like raymond chandler meets tim burton   the plot manny uncovers is convoluted brilliant deeply twisted and diabolical like you 've never imagined possible   it 's also incredibly unspeakably funny   tim schaefer is one absurd individual make no mistake yes it 's an old game i know   but the true classics know no age and this is a classic all right   so take advantage of the price snap it up and book a trip with your new favorite travel agent   he 's waiting for you ...
grim fandango combines every element you look for in an adventure game in a fluent and involving fashion   the plot the comedy the political intrigues an occasional romance ...   all right here   one of the things i found most amusing was whenever manny the main character   manages to build his life or is it death up again you the player   takes over and manages to ruin it in a day   whew think i got enough   parenthesis in   if you enjoy an easy going adventure game with a great   story to tell this game 's for you
possibly the most original game idea in the history of adventure games grim fandango has a charm which is all in the execution   this is as close to being in a movie as the adventure game genre has yet allowed   blending the tradition of mexican folklore with the suave of sixties beat   culture and the style of the big combo fandango is a sensory   explosion   somewhat courageously it does not attempt to make its   graphics realistic   rather it searches successfully to use its medium to   best effect   like the best films fandango manipulates its elements to   produce a world unto itself   its first rate direction and hitherto   unique to adventure games 3d technology   points the way forward for the   adventure games true some of the puzzles are hard but none of them   really seem out of place   indeed there is with grim fandango a true   sense of plot   maybe the characters do n't develop as they do in novels or   great films but thanks to fine vocal talent and crisp writing they do   maintain charming integrity throughout if i have a complaint with the   game it is the interface by which your character manny communicates with   others   you choose from among several sentence options like those old   quot;choose an ending&quot books   it 's not a bad way to play a game i   suppose but just as multiple choice tests are always easier than writing   essays being able to choose from amongst a few limited options make it   easier to get information out of the rest of the game 's cast   as a   result solving problems is sometimes dead simple   of course there are n't   many better options for game developers trying to give players a sense of   control of their destinies but it makes one long for the day when the   promise of a game like titanic with its limited ability to understand   unique phrases typed in by the player might be more fully realized some people though might like the fact that they exhaust their   investigations of other characters pretty quickly   it does speed game   play and is n't as frustrating as trying to find the right questions on   your own might be   this is a big game with lots of scenes and lots of   people to meet   speed of play matters   so even if i personally believe   there must be a better way to communicate to other characters i can hardly   rate the game down for what is possibly the best solution currently   available thus even if you think you do n't like adventure games you   should still buy grim fandango   likewise if you do n't have time to play   adventure games you should get a walkthrough and cheat your way to the   end because the graphics story and soundtrack are just that good   this   is one of the seminal achievements in the genre and to miss out on it   would be to accept a huge gap in your understanding of where the games   industry might be heading
i found half life to be somewhat interesting although it started to run thin by the ending levels not many of the levels were amazing either just long hallways small rooms and an occasional elevator shaft that you   climb up i like 3d games that let you be outside looking over vast plains   of enemies and obstacles half life just did n't cut it in this   arena another thing that i found most disturbing was the extreme   gore violence that is present throughout the game when your science   project goes wrong you walk out to find a scientist lying on the ground   with about 10 gallons of blood spread all over the walls and floor were   the programmers just trying to be sick here or what when you reach the   levels in which you begin to fight the army grunts who are the best   enemies it gets even more grotesque if you let off an entire clip of   bullets at one guy expect to see a wall covered with blood sure you can   turn it off but it does very little good the blood is still very   disturbing this is one aspect of the game that is extremely unacceptable   i am not a parent saying this either i 'm a teenager aside from the   violence and lack of interesting levels the game is pretty much void of   any lasting qualities if you want a weekend of pure hell both keeping you   stuck to your computer and grossing you out entirely then buy this game   otherwise do n't bother
this game is definitely a hundred steps past quake and others of its type the ai is great the evolving story is great the fight against the special forces team is nerve wrackingly great however all this greatness became   stale i never bothered to finish the game the game just seemed to grow   old after a time maybe it needs something more to carry the player   through
even though this game is almost 15 years old and uses a modified quake engine it is still one of the most fun and best shooters ever to be made in fact all other first person shooters and games in general can learn from half life 1 the game world is extremely immersive there are no level ends there is no text to read there are no scores and everyone talks to you without freezing you into a cut scene all of this makes you feel less like you are a player playing a game but you are indeed the hero gordon freeman characters recognize you talk to you and you can have them come with you or stay put security guards that come with you will shoot enemies slowly).the story is that you are silent protagonist gordon freeman you 'll feel like him by the end and you work for black mesa your standard super secret facility something goes horribly wrong and uh the formula is very simple but they execute it so well that other games have copied it and failed doom 3 needless to say you need to fight your way out through the facility on the desert being chased by a helicopter and everything else would just be a spoiler there are no levels no loading screens loading is seamless and happens during downtime half life 1 has simple controls and an optional tutorial level there are buttons for jumping crouching sneaking using your flashlight that needs to be off to charge it shooting secondary shooting for machine guns and using things the game is always in run mode and character speed seems to be fast too fast sometimes but there is that sneak button that will slow you down but how is the first person shooting there is a wide variety of guns and each has a certain joy and usefulness to them even the simple pistol is useful for lesser enemies 8 hours into the game there is a shotgun a machine gun with grenade launcher grenades explosives you detonate wall sensors with explosives a harpoon a laser guided rocket launcher that once it launches you point your cursor and it will turn accordingly lasers homing missiles head crabs and more an amazing array that you continue to get even up to the final levels areas to swap weapons you push 6 number keys and press some keys twice to access some weapons like the shotgun machine gun harpoon you start with a crowbar good for breaking grates and destroying boxes destroying boxes is how you will find most items and ammo instead of just finding things scattered on the floor on shelves or on a desk you need to bash open boxes to find the good stuff you can also push or pull the boxes too which is nice for puzzle solving and platforming the enemies are just as diverse and each one requires you to think and act differently since i do n't know the name of any enemy i 'll fumble through this the start enemies are lesser creatures that will start on the floor and jump at you 2 shots from a pistol take them out there are zombie ish aliens that take a shotgun or two but they are easy enough to avoid aliens that teleport in and beam electricity at you will cause you to hide pudgy little alien crawler hoppers will make you shoot from a distance because they will send out a small shockwave standard soldiers that will shoot machine guns throw grenades and coordinate attacks against you like flanking ceiling huggers that are yucky red globs on the ceiling with long rope like tongues that when they catch you you 'll be pulled up and eaten ... if you do n't shoot them giant aliens with homing missiles too there is a wide variety of enemies and bosses i ca n't list them all the game also shines with its tricks and traps and will throw a puzzle or challenge at you to keep you thinking but in this game it does n't feel like a puzzle or a challenge it seems natural there can be a hidden turret where the fun is making your choice how to take it out ... grenade explosive shooting it and getting shot in the process running by it or just not hitting the trip wire to start it in general wall sensor explosives push and pull box puzzles pushing buttons hopping hanging boxes over a pit conveyer belts using a sky cannon to destroy walls using turrets on rails vehicles that you have a lot of control over water puzzles high jump pads and so on there is a lot of variety and it 's never the same thing twice to sum it up this is a diverse and very fun game it has a sense of humor to it and you 'll feel like you are gordon freeman through the game 's well crafted immersion puzzles shooting and challenges all melded together into one fantastic game and i ca n't say that too often
i was never a big fan of the first person shooter fps genre but after giving half life a try thanks to all of the glimmering reviews i am absolutely hooked from the opening tram sequence you 're mesmerized by   gordon freeman 's plight and the falling black mesa world surrounding him   it 's a game that keeps you in a trance from midnight to the first crack of   sunlight apologies to my wife after dishing out punishment to those   marines be sure to frag some people in the outstanding multiplayer modes   the fun gets even better and the taste of death is even sweeter when you   blow apart that guy with 196 kills half life is truly a work of art   opposing forces here i come
maybe its me but half life is too crude to be an engaging play   been meaning to play it for years but never got to it   i played half life 2 first and that is simply the best experience in gameing i 've ever had   it is brilliant   i can see how 2 is a derivative and continuation of 1.but after a few hours i simply could not take the constant jumping missing dying   and the totally totally obscure paths through each scene   the long passages with no health   the obscure mazes and constant times of being squished   after a while i became so frustrated i simply stopped playing the game there were some jump fall sqish episodes where replayed the silly jump part over 100 times   i think that the playability is dated just like the graphics   the peculiar movement where you always run and have to press shift just to walk and not fall or overshoot where you 're trying to get to is simply not a current way to control movement all in all a charming prequel to the best game ever   i 'm sure this game was truly groundbreaking 7 8 years ago when it first shipped   but by today 's standards its not for me at least   i can not wait for more from valve as they are fantastic   but this one i 'll pass forever
i bought the original when it first came out in 1998 in late 2004 valve rereleased half life with the update source engine used in half life 2 there is no new content though i decided to play source to coincide with the 10th anniversary of this amazing game source just has more realistic water a better physics engine ragdolls some better lighting effects cleaner mapping and new 3d skybox i am happy i have played source but the differences between this and the original may not be enough to justify the costs the differences are not really noticeable so if you want to play half life just know that there are two versions of the game out there half life standard and half life source now to the story so far ... in the beginning ... there was nothing new much in the half life game engine which was essentially just a modern hack of the quake game engine so how could a game that based itself on software that others developed succeed in becoming the biggest selling game of all time when half life first came out it did a couple of things right that most other first person shooters failed to do ... 1)story 2)story and 3)story valve created half life in a period of our lives when area 51 was a hot topic among ufo buffs and the x files was to become mainstream family television viewing alien based entertainment media was a craze in the mid and late 1990 's unprecedented since the 1950s smack in the middle of what could be considered the most influential era for ufo enthusiasts came half life where you get to play as gordon freeman a physics researcher who witnesses a freak accident in an area 51 type facility all hell breaks loose and you have to survive no cut scenes no initial story no explanation you where just there and you had to escape cue interactive characters that could follow you around and say a few things maps rich in objects that you could break eventually leading up to rapid action shootouts with monsters and marines playing hl again was simply reliving that experience all over yes games have improved but this offering still destroys a lot of the competition valve just did it right and there is no reason not to want to load this up and give it a whirl again let 's face it this is gaming history half life changed the fps scene in ways other games have since tried but failed has there ever been a revolution in fps quite like half life some may have come close but not nearly as far that is how important this game is
the good game holds up 10 years later one of the best told stories in gaming history a lot of memorable moments tons of mods availablethe bad graphics look hideous these days newer gamers will hate this due to all the flaws that stick out to many mazy levelsman o man does this bring back a lot of good memories i remember almost dying because my mom 's computer could n't run hl1 i begged her to get the computer upgraded at the time not even knowing how this was possible or the cost she just would n't do it all i could do was stare at videos and screenshots until i thought would be forever da da da until i heard about the ps2 port i was so excited i babysat my bratty sisters for a whole summer and laid down 200 smackeroonies on a used ps2 but to my luck hl was no where to be seen it turns out not many copies of the game were made so they were scarce settling with a rental i finally was able to play the game but it was starting to feel old because i did n't get ahold of it until late 2003 realizing that i was missing out on a lot at the time i wound up losing my save and being so angry never touched the game again four years later i can finally play the game again thanks to steam i actually ordered the hl1 anthology off of ebgames for 20 and i definitely realized what i missed now that i have finally been able to finish the game half life used the quake ii engine at the time which was fighting against the unreal engine technically while half life never looked as good as unreal valve pulled some strings and did some custom stuff with the physics water and lighting effects that was n't originally in the q2 engine hl is n't just your regular run gun shooter the story is told all in real time by running into certain characters and by just progressing you get an idea of what 's going on without much dialog this was revolutionary at the time and so were the weapons graphics sound physics and enemies the game has your usual weapons like machine guns with grenade launchers pistols revolvers etc but hl has some weapons up it 's sleeve that were never seen before those such weapons happen to be a laser guided rocket launcher you guide it with your mouse i remember people buzzing about this weapons back in the day and it 's still pretty cool you also have the bee gun which is a weird slimy thing that shoots killer bees you have some strange electricity guns mines laser mines satchel charges etc the enemies were also something never seen before like the head crabs head crab zombies the ichthyosaur the vortigaunts etc the game also had huge bosses which was amazing back in the day and seemed very epic the game was dark creepy and very hard as well most shooters back in the late 90 's were just run gun nonsense in dark tunnels military complexes etc half life is not innocent and does do this but there are other places to see like climbing a huge canyon and looking out over the ugly vista that looks like the grand canyon today it looks like someone slapped a low res jpeg image in the background but in the late 90 's things like this seemed like you were staring over a grindlift in gears of war 2 half life was just so real and so amazing back in it 's day that it really kind of shocks you how such an old game can still make that kind of impact the game also consists of a lot of maze like halls that you can get easily lost in and i found this the main problem with hl some of the puzzles were a bit confusing to do and navigating the endless halls calls for a much needed walkthrough while the level design is excellent and you pretty much know where to go there are those occasional moments that make you wander around the whole area a few times and look in every nook and cranny wondering what switch you missed or what do you need to go through some neat things back in the day was being able to have the blue shift men help you and ask scientists to open doors for you while this is standard these days this kind of ai was unknown to the late 90 's pc gamers this added to the realism and made you fee like you really are stuck in black mesa trying to fight off the alien invasion you're probably wondering what the story is right well it 's simple really gordan freeman that 's you arrives in anomalous hazards as a regular employee and an experiment goes awry and gordan must escape the facility and figure out the source of the alien invasion the story as i 've already said is n't told through cut scenes but rather in real time while you play this helps add to the experience but of course may bore most younger pc gamers who are used to fear crysis cod etc half life is for the hardcore old school pc shooter fans only and really takes cunning skill to finish the game will give you less and less health as you go and you 'll have to figure out how to take out a room of 10 bad guys with only 2 health while this is n't impossible it can be done and requires precise skill thus only for hardcore fans).most of you have probably played hl2 already and these games are pretty much completely different besides the content you still have your hazard suit most of the weapons are the same but there is more stuff in hl1 about 40 of the weapons and enemies in hl1 are n't in hl2 hl2 is more realistic while hl1 is more of a sci fi type game thankfully you can play hl2 without even touching hl1 which i did but hl1 explains a lot of things that are n't explained in hl2 and there are bits in hl2 that are for fans of hl1 that you normally would n't know about unless you played this game now of course hl1 has a lot of flaws like floaty physics being able to run 100 mph cheap deaths poor graphics but these are flaws seen from age if you were to warp back to 1998 the game was almost flawless now when it comes to upgrades and mods there is an endless ocean there are a ton of amazing multiplayer and singe player mods available and i have spend hours and hours on most of them you must go to fileplanet.com and download these mods because they are super fun hl1 also has a free hi def pack that you can download to update the graphics a little bit if you want to go even further pick up half life source which uses hl2 's engine to make things look more modern i highly recommend the source version for people who just ca n't stand old graphics but old school shooter fan should just get the hi def pack just for nostalgia 's sake
half life revolutionized pc gaming   it is one of the greatest if not the best pc game ever made   it has bin said that from almost every pc mag or game mag   i was a few to own this masterpiece when it first hit stores and all i can say is ... wowthis game really changed about the fps gaming   it just made me think different about fps   it truly is a masterpiece   i wo n't spoil this games amazing story of the g man 's adventure   i wo nt even say how good this game is you just have to play it for your self the graphics for that time was amazing and so will the upcoming half life 2 baby   nuff saidthe gameplay ....... you're a moron if you acctually think i 'm gon na go into that since we already no how incredible the game is .... nuff saidthe story is what makes this game ... a game .. it 's not just any shooter ... it 's history in the making .. well for games atleast ... i'm just gon na make this short and sweet for you ... this game is amazing!of course this deserves a5 out of 5 stars!!!!!!!amazing ... just amazing ... nuff said get the game before hl2 comes out .. lates ..
fans of dedicated single player first person shooter games who 've never played this game before should definitely not pass it up   hl takes an utterly unoriginal idea for either games or movies and crafts an utterly unstoppable gaming experience   you play gordon freeman who works in the bowels of an ultra secret underground research facility called the black mesa   having played the game yet i 'm still not sure what 's supposed to be going on in bm it 's what happens that matters   oozing high tech the facility is host to another dimension when you freeman accidentally ... do something that tears a whole in the fabric of our own allowing beings from that other world to enter ours now if you think that these otherworldly denizens are peaceful beings intent on fostering cross dimensional love or that your fellow human beings will enter the black mesa unarmed intent on warmly welcoming these beings to our world i 'm afraid you 've picked up the wrong game entirely   for in the bowels of black mesa you 'll confront howling dog things flying crabs alien zombified versions of your colleagues gigantic aliens that breathe fire through their fists aliens that hang from ceilings and entrap their victims using these vine looking things and squads of human special forces troops intent on killing everything that moves   if the above attracts you because you think it may be the setting that elevates the nobility of the human existence i should warn you to look elsewhere for in half life you 'll find yourself acting indiscriminately with a 9 mm automatic a submachine gun grenades and most regrettably of all a nasty crowbar you 'll make few friends and find yourself for the most part alone and not infrequently exiled to ventilation ducts again with the ducts to avoid getting shot at by humans or burned bitten bolted or tongue bathed by aliens   complex problem solving skills as much as marksmanship or bullet saving are crucial in this game in which your enemies have above average levels of ai   there are unfortunately times when a level may be hung up by the failure to achieve some specific mission goal but this is on the whole a game in which the goals are sufficiently complex to make you feel cool for achieving them yet not so complex as to be impossible to solve   the settings are fantastic from the vast to claustrophobic   the game is long uncommitted gamers may find it tedious but the scope of design here rewards those who keep up with it i ran this game on an xp equipped p4 with a 64 mb agp card and had no problems other than those involving the evil aliens and homicidal fellow humans   graphics and sound were smooth and i suffered no ctd 's
made in 98 but still better quality play and design than most games on the market in 05   good storyline great ai and graphics not overly aggressive system requirments tons of add ons available   incredible single player mode good weapon selection and arguably one of the best fps online games of all time   if you like halo you will like halflife   very similar but no limit on how many weapons you can carry and the levels are n't as repetative   my biggest complaint about halo though it 's obvious why many of the levels and hallways are exact copies of one you 've seen dozens of times already ... gives a feeling of being lost and even fed up at times halo does have the edge as far as cars and what not though i also recommend halflife 2 the sequel to what i 'm talkin about here ...   insane graphics and gameplay
posibly the best game i ever played this game is great u may think u should just rent it but dont this game is so long it took me bout 2 months to pass it.there is a great storyline.i played all of hl games and this is the best one.for example in half life 1 u get to a radio and a soldier says there to retreat if u play opposing forse ull see this guy saying same thing to abort and same voice.great story line great wepons great multiplayer.trust me ull never get tired of this game get the game!!!p.s. you wo nt regret this
i usually turned off all lights and played game in deep night after a whole day work even on bloody quake i or doom ii it is ok and i was for a long time a quake ii fan esp in single player mode with numerous add on levels distributed on the web i thought the 3d shooter game has   reached the limit in quake ii but alas what a game the half life is   i   dare not played it in the deep night alone with all lights off with a very   good storyline and excellent atmosphere the game is horrible   you never   know what the next step will be the monsters are not stupidly standing   there waiting for your bullets instead they are chasing and hunting you   it is simply the best single player 3d shoot game so far
alright already it 's a great game good ai graphics runs well atmospheric great story and dialogue comedy blah blah blah wait a minute i got a complaint that movie in the beginning you ca n't escape   it it just goes on and on babbling while you 're stuck in a stupid tram   car sheesh what a bore that kind of nonsense will cost you a star   later i went thru that ride a few times because i grew to like the eerie   understated music still i think i should have been able to skip the intro   movie ruined the whole game for me
great game old now of course but still fun to play good gameplay and pretty good graphics not the best but good fun shooter the half life series is really successful and this is the game that started it you do nt have to have a great computer to play this game and that s the plus of it i never beat this game but got close to it i just got stuck lol if you are new to the half life series then this is the game to get check it out
i did n't like this game when i first saw it at e3 but when i went back   and played it it turned out to be pretty good not too many boss monsters   i hate those things some of the monsters are rather agile the weapons   are new the graphics are extremely pretty nice colors great water you   can configure all sorts of things there are some good guys to help you out   they show you hidden goodies and the game makes a lot of effort to be   stable hey they even have a story and little logs you can read to get a   feel for the story it 's not as story scripted as half life but then it   does n't have the awful xen world either and many people prefer the   realistic weapons of quake to the unusual ones of unreal i like the   built in bots in multiplayer i think this was the first game to ship with   them but i 'm told the net play is really slow
well that 's what cgw editor jeff green called quot;unreal&quot after playing it i 'm inclined to agree it incorporates on a small scale elements of adventure games which slows down the first person action   without actually adding much weight to the alleged story it does look   nice though at least for a 1997 era game
this has to be the most detailed and beautifully rendered game ever made   the monsters look real the weapons look sleek and the animation is very realistic with no jerkiness   unfortunately this game requires totally   unreal system requirements   anything less than a pentiumii/300mhz   processor runs like garbage unless everything is turned down and well   there goes the graphics   this game was the chief reason for my system   being upgraded   also remember the sleek weapons i described   well   they 're sleek but that 's it   for crying out loud it takes three hits   with a rocket launcher to kill one of the basic enemies the skaarj   there 's no bang to them at all   plus another good thing about unreal is   the multiplayer games where you can play against computer controlled   opponents bots   sounds good right   wrong   unless you put the skill   level down nearly all the way simply aiming a gun at the bot will cause it   to zig zag in a way that is impossible to hit all while shooting at you   with godlike aim   other than the steep system requirements the   difficulty of the bots and the bangless weapons the game is very good and   highly customizable for all those hackers and map makers out there   you 'll   get your money 's worth but i hope you 're good at strafing while shooting   otherwise you 'll never win
i was feeling nostalgic last week so i started playing unreal again   probably for my third time through at this point   while unreal does n't have as much replay value as a game like half life it certainly does have its moments   unreal was one of those really impressive fps games for it 's time   it boasted great graphics and intense game play   of course by 2008 's standards these graphics merely look silly   but if you were picking this up in 98 like i was you were pretty impressed i figure i 'll throw in some points about playing this on a more current system since i experienced some issues here and there   being a game made for windows 98 it does n't translate perfectly over to an xp 32 bit system   i have no idea what this would do on vista 's 64 bit architecture   basically when re installing it i got a strange error with the option to ignore   you can definitely get away with doing that and then it will install fine   strangely every time you reinsert the disc to play some more you have to cancel out of the install process and that ignore message comes up as well   i 'm not sure if this is just my system but i recommend saving quite frequently at least every time you hit a load screen   for some reason the game will randomly crash after a little while and it exits out completely for you   this can be frustrating if you 've been playing for a while because it does n't auto save between load screens   otherwise it played very smoothly on the newer system   you can also get the unreal anthology which has been updated to handle windows xp   oh and this was on a pentium 4 3.0 ghz system that being said i 'll move onto the actual review for anyone thinking about delving into this great game for their first time   the first thing you notice is that you have almost no health   you begin to discover why as you start wandering around a crashed space ship and it appears you were some kind of prisoner   naturally the first things you need to do are finding some health and then find some way out of the ship   the ship is kind of a boring part of the level but it leads you a bit into the story line because you clearly crash landed on an alien planet   when you finally get out of the ship the first thing you 'll notice is how amazing and stunning the world is that has been created for you   outside it 's very bright and vibrant in spots   this felt a little different compared to games like quake half life doom because a lot of those games are very dark and have a major dungeon crawl atmosphere to them   unreal has a lot of that usual stuff as well but it also has a lot of time spent outside where you get to see amazing scenery   one thing the developers did right was making you feel like the in game world was huge   this was really impressive and fun when you first got into it as you explore and interact with the world you learn more about what 's going on with this planet called na pali   apparently the native people are called the nali and they 've been enslaved by an alien race called the skaarj   the nali are extreme pacifists and i ca n't help but think their designers wanted them to be buddhists for the most part   the skaarj on the other hand are the main enemy of the game though not the only enemy creatures you 'll face   they are a warrior race that pretty much takes over wherever it sees fit   you 'll notice that the skaarj design is clearly influenced by predator   they have a humanoid lizard design and have a mouth design that looks just like that of a predator   to brandish even more similarities they also have energy weapons and steel double claws attached to their arms   as you can see this is n't very original   another part that is kind of unoriginal strange is the nali castles that you come across   they are clearly living in what we would term a medieval level society versus the skaarj who have high grade technology   strangely you come across large castles that look like they 're straight out of thirteenth century england   i know ... strange for a race of pacifists   despite all this those parts are some of the most fun to play through   i loved going into the castles and running around!another aspect that made unreal very special when compared to other fps games was the sheer amount of atmosphere that is injected into this game   it truly does feel like you 're on an alien world   the sounds the textures were all there perfectly bringing you into this world almost so much that you did n't want to leave   you even hear echoes off of cliffs if you 're walking through a cavern it 's like they tried to get as many little details in order to immerse the user   for it 's time the unreal graphics engine was also very impressive and really took things up a notch in the gaming world   they also programmed enemies to react more realistically to the user when confronted   so when i 'm fighting against the skaarj enemies they will actually make an effort to jump out of the way of my shots   this was really cool to see and i really only found that in games like half life the maps you have to navigate through are pretty massive at times   i really felt like a lot of the level design was also influenced by the great game marathon   a lot of times in order to open a door you have to search out a series of levers or whatever in order to proceed onto the next section   this game literally has hours of game play and probably took me in the vicinity of 20 to 30 hours to complete so you really get your moneys worth   the downfall to having such large maps is it 's kind of easy to get lost sometimes if you 're trying to complete certain tasks   another detriment to the game was the lighting   i put this game on maximum brightness levels in order to help me see where i was going   sometimes that was n't even bright enough   there are sections of this game that are absolutely dark especially towards the end of the game   while this creates a very scary atmosphere i felt it hindered the game play once in a while   the reason this hurts game play is because the flashlight function is incredibly annoying to deal with   you have to pick up flashlights or flares in order to see in the pitch black areas   now to make it more realistic the flashlights eventually run out of batteries or something but this was poorly incorporated because they only last a few minutes   seriously the flashlights in real life would not die so quickly and then it 's up to you to go find another one   the only reason this hurts the game is because if you no longer have light you ca n't enjoy the environment nearly as much aside from a couple flaws this is a pretty awesome game and i had a lot of fun playing it   in 98 this came out around the same time as half life and they were both the must play fps games that year   half life ultimately won the game of the year slot mainly because of story line   unfortunately unreal 's story line is pretty poor in the greater scheme of things   the user does n't really feel a greater purpose to their mission and instead you are merely trying to complete levels and puzzles   whereas half life created a vastly well written world where you were trying to get out of a facility and stop an experiment gone out of control   unreal just could n't compete with something of that caliber and it 's not nearly as engrossing on that level   beautiful world and really fun to play overall but not the best of the year overall rating 4.5 out of 5
this game is fun to play just for looking at all of the scenery i enjoy all the brilliant colors and the array of monsters to kill this is a quake type game but is better in everyway except the weapons just plain   fun
well going into it i heard that this was so much better than quake iii arena   i had played that game and i liked it   so i gave unreal a go   after playing for a while i played quake iii again   within a few minutes   i quit quake uninstalled unreal and went back to playing quake   the   difference in the graphics was incredable   all the sharp edges are fine   but i perfer the revolutionaly rounded surfaces   quake iii blew unreal out   of the water graphically   what about the game play   well i was kidna   dissapointed   quake iii is very intense the kind of game you get caught   up in   i found myself playing unreal just to see what it was like   it   had no draw whatsoever   i thought the weapons were fairly difficult to   use and were kinda cheesy   for me it is all quake iii
really enjoyed this classic fps hardcore gamers wo nt be disappointed i highly recommend purchasing graphics are great story line is solid and not so short audio is excellent and the price is right
unreal is one of those games that has stuck with me ever since i first played it in fact i ca n't think of any game that i actually like as much as unreal the environments are beautiful and compelling the ai is fairly clever and the atmosphere is simply masterful in the singleplayer campaign you are prisoner 849 your prison ship has crashed and now you have to escape when you leave the ship you get slapped in the face with awe inspiring environments excellent atmosphere beautiful skies and inspiring music instead of having cutscenes or cinematics unreal tells its story through translator messages i prefer it that way cutscenes would have gotten in the way unreal is also great for the fact that it supports coop up to 16 players the environments vary but all of them are generally very well done aside from coop unreal also has deathmatch and team deathmatch modes and a variety of others such as darkmatch unreal also comes with the unreal editor in it you can make your own levels admittedly it 's difficult to get used to but nevertheless is an excellent addition it is marred with quite a few bugs however unreal is a truly brilliant game the environments music atmosphere and story have made it last a very long time for me it may have aged but no game since has managed to grab my attention the way unreal did and no game has stuck with me for so long my advice buy the game it 's brilliant
i played unreal when i was 9 and beat it in a week the game is just plain awsome   unfortenutly that was 7 years ago and i doubt this will work on xp but when i m at his house i always play this amazing game   the begining is friggin scary when you re in the abandon space ship and all you hear are the lives of the sapce crew screaming and beging for there lives later you soon find out that they are being torn apart by these disturbing creatures or aliens i might say   more games should be like this the only game to be like this would probably be the suffering cause you here the voices of the co 's getting torn apart by weird disturbing creatures   maybe not the only game but there a little few games that are like unreal the begining parts were the best for me   the scream the horror   i think this is suppose to be a survival horror game i donno but get this game but i think they do nt make this game any more   any ways get this and unreal turnement   awsome games
the game may be old but it 's still fun as hell the scenery and graphics are really not that bad at all quite a change from traditional fps games ... which is definitely a good thing
in my humble oppinion this game is better the quake ii the graphics is better and the sound is so much better if you have a sound blaster live card then get this game because it was designed to run on this card
when the day i got unreal and tried it i loved it so much i started calling up friends and telling them how incredible thatgame was the gameplay is one of best gameplay ever experiencedin a game you are a prisoner in a prisoner vessel headingto a prison moon believed to be called(the prison ship):vortexrikers but when the skaarj detect you and pull you on to the once peaceful planet of napali then all goes wrong!your best friend gets eaten by a skaarj you barely manage to escape a now turned to a skaarj slaughter prison vessel you reach outside grounds and say this ca n't be real no it 's not it 's unreal!unreal takes you through 39 heart beating breath taking missions where you fight for life to survive collecting itemslike defenses and weapons travel through temples facilitys castles bases mountians journey through what napali has to offer and end up and the skaarj mothers ship confronting the queen skaarj ....... unaided and alone!i would indenefinetley recommend this game to first person sci fi fan shooters
this game is so incredible the graphics the sound quality the digital music the gameplay the ai everything about it .... when i first stepped outside of the prison ship using opengl support(using 3d hardware rendering on your 3d video card along with 3dhardware support sound quality at maxium and using a pentium2 350 tnt 3d video card 128 sdram and 16 mb of harddrive space it ran incredible it was unreal.but i 've been hearing about why 3dfx support from voodoo video cards looks so incredible i 've been wondering that it 's more incredible that opengl or direct3d support still this game kicks behind}!!!!!buy it!!!!!only 7 dollars today stop by at eletronics boutique and buy this game!!!!!(i reccomend at least a shiny new pentium two a whole lot of memory for a example 128 mb of sdram 6gs of harddrive space and a powerful 3d sound card and a 3d video card with lot 's of ram on it
as a fan of myst and riven i would not put this game in the same   category   however it does equally well for it 's type   myst and riven   do n't have a main character that you are per se whereas in this game you   have a name and a face the game puts you in the shoes of one agent craig   wilmore   he is put on a case to find the missing x files staff agents fox   mulder and dana scully   as an x files fan i found this game very   entertaining   as a gamer it was well within the genre of adventure games   there were hints stuff to pick up things to do etc   this was well   within the capabilities of non x filers and should be equally entertaining i likened this game to the gabriel knight 2 the beast within and   phantasmagoria   unlike phantasmagoria there were no gory scenes of which   i was thankful the people were movies of real people and not cartoons   the dialgue though limited offered enough variability one important point   would be to save often   i got killed alot the game had enough of a   plot you could figure out what to do next   that is essential rather than   blindly clicking on everything you could pick up all in all a good buy   when 's the next one
this was a pretty good game but not a great game i 'd probably rate this closer to 3 1/2 stars you are agent craig wilmore scully amp mulder have disappered and it 's your job to find them you have several locations to go to and many people to talk to in your search a couple of the features i really like was you actually have a shoot out that you control in one location and in another location you have to do a real time search to catch the quot;bad&quot guys towards the end most of the cast members from the show are here skinner the cigarette smoking man amp the lone gunmen but they were n't used nearly enough there were some cool explosions and the story was pretty good but they could have made this a little harder in some aspects and a little easier like being able to get a password for your own computer why was this so hard overall a good game but just a few more additions and changes and this could have been a great game
this was not the best mystery adventure game i 've ever played and i 'm not even a big fan of such games to begin with but i am a serious x phile   despite the seven cds full of full motion video than make up the game it was n't a whole lot like being in an x files episode   instead it was more like being one of those quot;other agents&quot who make brief appearances two or three times per season   you actually have to do some of the tedious legwork to collect evidence instead of having it conveniently handed to you after the commercial break   of course the up side to that is a more immersive believable feel to the game and a feeling of accomplishment when you finally do spot the crucial clue fans of the series will find plenty of references to themes conspiracies events and trivia from various episodes as well as the familiar faces   while it 's not strictly necessary to recognize all the references to the series in order to solve the mystery it does add quite a bit to the game if you 're not a fan of the x files there are better mystery adventure games out there   if you find mystery adventure games frustrating you probably wo n't like this one even if you are a fan   on the other hand if you do enjoy both this type of game and the series it 's based on you 'll have a lot of fun with this game
we stopped watching the series lack of time and so this was a nice way   to keep the excitement going the game is good perhaps a little   disorienting at first i spent the first hour sitting at craig willmore 's   desk doing nothing once you get the hang of it though it follows   quite nicely because you have so much freedom in navigation you decide   where to go but things wo n't happen until you come back to the right place   at the right time it feels like the game is non linear in fact it is   rather linear although you have a few variations i was n't disappointed in   the ending but not thrilled either it did n't blow me away we got stuck a   couple of times but we managed to make it without a walkthrough in about a   week the rule of this game is save often and organize your saves keep   the last save before you change cds they correspond roughly to major   developments you might need to restart from there because you forgot to   do something crucial or because you died i got killed a lot too you   need lots of frequent saves and a few less recent and a few even less   recent not to have to restart from scratch if you believe you forgot   something at the beginning of the game but overall the storyline is quite   intuitive and you 'll be fine if you make connections buy this game if   you like the series but you 're not a fanatic you 'd be disappointed and   you 'll have a good time if you can stand occasionally being stuck and turn   it into a challenge rather than into a frustration
i have had this game since 1999 i really enjoy playing it i have been playing it again and again off and on for few years now i just recently decided to play it again so i installed it on my windows 7 professional 32 bit version computer after doing the following compatibility for it works just fine on windows 7 professional install the latest quick time do not install the version on the cd also during install it looks for hard drive space since this was during a time that hard drive was not very big it will say there not enough hard drive space just hit ignore it will continue with the install if you have windows 7 professional 32 bit version all i did was click compatibility run under windows xp(service pack 3 and run this program as an administrator was all i checked however if you have the windows 7 64bit version you will need to enable to run at the 32bit version level most likely
i used to love this game but now it 's dated and now that i look back on it it 's not as fun now either way here 's my review graphics 8.5/10 this is a more realistic snowboarding game so there are very realistic colors unlike snowboarding kids or anything with very bright colors 1080 features very realistic physics and is very sophisticated anyways the graphics i remember loving mainly because of the powdery snow i liked to edge in deep snow just because it was it was so fluffy for that this game got what it got in this category sound 9/10 whether you go through a foot of snow or right accross jagged ice there 's a different noise there is a different sound for everything which is strange because really for the most part in many games on the n64 there is the same or a very similar song for everything in the game control 8/10 very very realistic and solid but it 's frustrating for that reason it is really realistic so you really have to land flat to get land which can be frustrating for little kids there is also damage so if you get beat up a lot you will not win the race fun 8.5/10 nice and realistic great events and different difficulties for every age and cool characters make this a must play for any   owner of an n64.9/10
this game definitly fits the thought i had of a snowboarding game when i set out to buy one the graphics are moderately realstic the control is ok and the sound is mediocre i think they could of done a lot better job designing a game like this but this edition suffices it is one of the only snowboarding games on the n64 which was one of the reasons i bought it another reason is the outstanding multiplayer coordination i bought this as soon as i played it at a friend 's house you unfortunatley play with only 2 players at a time but it is still fun to play your friend head to head   there are 6 courses and under single player you can also do half pipe and air make there are 5 characters that you can use to race and more of which you can unlock since there are only 60 head to head course combinations there are other things you can do like trick or time attacks this can take a bit to get used to as it can be boring for the single player if you have a will and a friend however this game will surely be worth it
i use to play this ages ago and use to be pretty good i started playing it again and i now found that the controls at least for me do n't seem very forgiving in order to do tricks you have to place the toggle in the exact correct place at least pretty spot on you also have to land in a specific position or else you crash too many crashes makes it so you ca n't finish the race the half pipe mode is pretty decent though and can range from super easy to insanely hard overall a not so bad game for that time
in comparison to other n64 games this piece is a worthwhile buy   the single player mode is challenging enough to warrant playing for a while to unlock the secret characters   two player mode gets pretty boring pretty quickly because there are only 6 tracks to race on so there 's not much variety   the stunt mode is the main appeal of the game and could easily occupy you for hours   however it soon just becomes a thumb spinning frenzy for points   given this is fun for a while but it gets all that white junk inside the control stick holder and ruins thumb coordination for the rest of the day   so buy this game and spin in circles to your heart 's content
this is the stuppidiest game i 've ever played i advise everyone not to play it or buy it it really sucked
the game in many ways is like tony hawk   in fact the only differnt thing this snowboarding   the graphic and gameplay are good   with 5 differnt boarders to use and alot of tracks the game is worth the money
i 'm 23 now got the game when it first came out when i was around 12 still the bet snowboarding game of all time so much fun that i still get the n64 out here and there simply to play this game has a time attack mode trick mode racing series and a mixture of them all just a great classic that rates up their with 007 goldeneye for classic n64 games that could last forever for those every now and then gamers like myself great game ... that 's highly reccomended
when my cousin first got this on his birthday i was thinking quot this is just gon na be like all the other snowboarding games i 've played&quot   man was i wrong   with 8 levels of exciting heart stopping jump twists and turns this is one game you do n't wanna miss   it has all the best modes match race&lt;this is where you earn hidden levels against the computer&gt 2 player trick attack time attack and contest this is one game that wo n't get tiring fast   heed this warning if you buy this game do n't go after the 1080 just yet it 's hard to master   what more do i have to say   buy this game
once you get the hang of the controls this game is awesome ... it 's challenging and entertaining and everyone should have one this game has amazing graphics-- you can even see the snow spray off the board when you make the slightest turn plus the camera controls are flawless the sound track is pretty good too- you can hear the snowboard scraping and the snowboarders sometimes talk and the techo tracks that accompany the races are pretty cool too my only complaint is that there are n't enough courses after i unlocked the 6 courses and beat the quot;black diamond&quot level there was n't much else to do but even after you 've unlocked all the courses it 's still fun to play against your friends in the 2 person vs mode or doing tricks in the half pipe i think that anyone who has a n64 should add this game to their collection without a doubt ... it 's a solid game and you wo n't regret it
this game is the hardest game i ve ever played and that takes away the fun also graphics very poor even for nintendo 64 can not even recommend for people i dislike do nt waste your time or money worst n64 game ever
without any doubt 1080 snowboarding is probably the best snowboarding game available the difficulty of the controls are a little more difficult than other snowboarding games and may take a little bit more time to master but it 's well worth it landing correctly is also a little harder to do than normal the mode and track selection is very nice offering a nice variety of tracks and available modes the tracks offer beautiful scenery sometimes very big jumps jumping over cars and a lot more the tricks and the stunts selection that you can perform is very reasonable although you ca n't go beyond 1080 degree turns there are other tricks that you might not find in any other snowboarding game.1080 also includes a training mode which includes two different sections the halfpipe and a straight run with moguls when you begin you can turn into the left gate for the halfpipe to practice your tricks or you can head into the right gate for a straight downhill run with moguls scattered all over when you finish you start back up at the main gate and you keep going until you decide to quit.1080 also has a few secret riders and boards within the game overall 1080 is probably the best snowboarding game around without any doubt would be definitely worth buying
this is the best snow boarding game you can get but you will get tierd of it soon
if you do n't read anything else if you find this game at a yard sale for 1.00 5.00 or online then go ahead and get it but in my opinion there are much better snow boarding games out for the n64 like big mountain 2000 twisted edge or even snowboard kids or snowboard kids 2."now i know that this was the n64 's first snowboarding game so we should n't expect the taj mahal in video game form here but having played the previous mentioned snowboarding games and then playing this there are some things that i dislike about this game first landing your snowboard in this game is more based on luck than skill first you have to press the z button when you land and secondly you ca n't move your control stick at all when you are landing or your player is going to fall over because the board is on an angle on screen that right there ruined the game for me because it sucked a lot of the fun right out of the game also if you want to try to play this game i recommend plugging in an n64 controller that has a joystick that is still very firm i started playing with my usually controller where the joystick is a little loose and i was pretty bad plugged in another controller with a firm joystick got instantly better controlling my character in the game second if you bump a wall you fall over there are other snowboarding games on the n64 that do that but here it seemed really prevalent third the music in this game is really annoying sounding i liked the title track but after that i was treated to songs that had people with high pitched or dull voices yelling the same things over and over again i would have preffered just straight up instrumental music here fourth i noticed that pretty much the only way of winning a race against the computer player was to take a short cut hidden in each course sure you could try to out board them but if you mess up 2 or 3 times hit a wall or wall over forget winning fifth when you enter the competition events you only get so many continues and let 's say you are playing on easy where there are 4 tracks and you want to quit the 3rd race because you know you are going to lose and do n't want to waste a continue so you go to select restart from the pause menu you are back on the first course and have to do everything over again aggh sixth i did some of the time attack modes i believe that 's the right name for it i am not positive right now anyway you have to board through certain goals they look like a traditional marathon finish line and i am playing the one level and the goal was on a cliff above me that i had no chance of getting on from where i was and time ran out and i lost why would they put something like that in the game put the goal lines where people have a good chance of getting to them not up on a cliff that i could of went up on 8 seconds ago but now i am stuck!!!i loved the look of this game that 's why it was so hard for me to let go of the thought of getting fully into this game i tried very hard to like this game but i still could n't bring myself to do that because of the mentioned above flaws if you can overlook them and you have the taste for snowboarding games you should be able to enjoy this game happy playing and thanks for reading merry christmas and best wishes for 2010 and beyond
i love the nintendo 64 i still play some games occasionally and this one was always a fun one it will frustrate you though
i was actually thinking about this game a few months ago and it was killing me that i could n't remember the name   this game was a ton of fun though i 'm sure if i played it now i would laugh at how dated it is   if you have a way to play this i recommend it   i blew a lot of hours on this game and would gladly pick it up again if they made it available for download on the ps3
azure dreams is n't really like other rpgs it 's actually more of a random dungeon game like chocobo dungeon and diablo these games really seem to   fit into there own category these days also it has a monster training part   to it where you brought you monster in the dungeon to fight for you also   within the game is a very weird part of plot you get to sees the faces of   the women you have gotten to become your loyal women while you save if you   run the story correctly on all of them in the end your basically the town   pimp as far as game play goes when entering the dungeon you are always   brought down to level 1 and only able to take 5 items inside this is an   annoying thing your monsters do not loose levels but as they survive they   loose magic and leave way to fast also to keep your weapons in poor shape   early you well have problems with rust traps which lower their quality   also there are items they raise the quality of the weapon and shield only   equipment you wear threw the game called sands a good thing to remember   is gold swords do not rust neither do diamond or mirror shields without   knowing that the game can get pretty boring faster the game is very   repetitive you end up doing the same thing over and over again while you   get to the deeper levels of the dungeon again and again even though they   change every time it does get old to meet the same monsters hoping for a   sand so you can get to the next floor again and again and again i fell   asleep while playing this game at least six times as far as plot goes   the plot within 27 hours of playing you well forget the game had a plot and   you well only be reminded in the very end the graphics to this game are   sprits they are not poorly done sprites but i have seen higher quality   there are many different looking monsters and every couple floors the   dungeon 's floor takes a new appearance but eventually it does some   repeating and none of the pictures are that beautiful and finally as far   as length of time it can stay interesting it depends on how patient you   are this game involves a lot of patience even though i fell asleep while   playing it many times i enjoyed it all the way until i beat it but if you   are going to play it its defiantly a buy game and not a rent   game overall this game is not for everyone but if your very patient and   you have a lot of free time to see a weird game that combines monster   raising dungeon exploring and ... rpg style control to dating get azure   dreams
fans of any oldschool dungeon crawler should snap this game up in a similar style to other games of the time you assume the roll of a monster hunter with a mission to climb a mysterious tower following in your father 's footsteps some may say the graphics are dated i feel that they are nostalgic with randomly generated dungeons spelunking is always a grand adventure a must have for any rpg lover
hard to find game most anywhere and only had the opportunity to rent it a while back and wanted to play again a lot like d and d i was told
9 out of 10 people will probably see this and pass it up as another cheap rpg for one thing you only have 1 dungeon gasp when you leve you level back down to 1 gasp and you capture monster just like in pokemon gasp   no it 's not a compelation of rip off 's this is a classic that is highly addicting and incredibly fun if given a chance the story revolves around a young lad you name who on his fifteenth birthday is given the opportunity to become a hunter and explore the depths of the monster tower to retrieve riches however to do so he must not only survive but grow as a trainer and as a man   in comes the kewe the monster you will likely use for a majority of the game   he is a fire type there are only three types and he is your brief tutorial and key to success early on .... you also must build up your respect to the townsfolk to do this you must enlarge certain places temple hospital and build new things library gym casino race track bowling alley ect .. and the town will grow to respect you now as for the tower it'self there are 40 floors everytime you leave you go back down to level 1   no it 's not immpossible for two reasons a your monsters level stays the same when you leave this is due to the fact that they are more like equipment b weapons and armors stay the same when a red or blue sand is used your weapons and armor grow more powerful so technically you can easily dominate the first few levels without you monsters assistance overall this game is tricky you will die the first few times lose all your items except monsters   but once they are strong enough you can succeed   there are 40 randomly changeing floors and they get more and more difficult as you go along   you must adjust your mosnters accordingly by class a)fireb)windc)waterfire beats wind water beats fire wind beats water i would buy this for the challenge it possess guarennteed addiction
this is most likely one of the best n64 games ever made its way better then super mario 64 in everyway and possibly zelda too its rich colorful and very addicting the soundtracks are also one of my favorite things about the game- it has a happy and also very awesome tune to them making them addictive you just ca nt stop listening to it and the world designs 10 total i believe are all very beautiful and gorgeous i 've beaten the game to 100 and i still go back to the worlds and gaze in thier amazement its just really cool this game is a must have for any nintendo 64 player i m serious if you do nt have this your missing out big time ps check out its sequel banjo tooie after you 've bought this
i 've had this game since way back when it was released i just never got the chance to write a review the story banjo 's sister tooty was the most beautiful girl around and grunty the witch wanted her beauty so she pulled an amber alert and took her to her lair banjo 's lazy bum the whole time was sleeping it 's up to you to get jiggy 's and notes and what not to stop grunty and get banjo 's sister back graphics 9.5/10 awesomely different and creative worlds from a sewer to a pirate ship on an island to a desert and into an icy snowland there are tons of different and unique worlds to play through the graphics are stellar for the n64 with bright colors and cool characters with good animations this is one of the best n64 games as far as graphics go next to games like donkey kong 64 and legend of zelda majora 's mask sound 9/10 there are n't really any voices in this game just kind of sound effects that are different for each character blubber on treasure grove cove sounds like he 's burping or throwing up kazooie sounds like a gagging bird banjo sounds like a big old hick of a bear ... and so on the music in this game though is some of the catchiest and the best music i 've heard in really any adventure game the music does n't really get old and whoever created it is brilliant overall the sound is really really good control 8.5/10 being an adventure game there are a lot of different controls for a lot of different moves and since the n64 controller is the way it is pretty annoying it 's easy to get confused even after playing for hours on end just because you go brain dead the controls are a bit strange at first to do some of the attacks but you will get used to them anyways fun 9/10 a great game from beginning to end get the jiggys move on get the notes move on that simple no this game is challenging and is for all ages even if it does have a kiddy approach the game lasts maybe 40 hours or so depending on how fast you get through the game great characters great level design and fantastic music makes this a must buy this is one of the best games on the n64 and i.m.o. the best adventure game pick this game up now it is better than its sequel and the game boy advanced ones even if all three are fantastic buy this game!!9.3/10
rare just has an extraordinary knack at making great games banjo kazooie was released in 1998 and has been considered a classic since and i too must agree with this well deserved honor well why do i find this game fantastic well i 'll explain that in my review first off let 's talk about banjo kazooie 's story banjo 's sister tooty is kidnapped by the wicked witch gruntilda gruntilda has planned on swapping tooty 's beauty to her but not if banjo and his friend kazooie can help it okay seriously this story is pretty lame but hey it 's a game in my opinion no matter how good the graphics are or how great the story is it all boils down to one thing and that 's gameplay and banjo kazooie has fantastic gameplay in banjo kazooie you play as banjo and ... well ... kazooie and kazooie stays inside banjo 's backpack at all times but she 's not useless they both work as a team and learn many moves which brings us to our next character bottles bottles the mole helps you learn different moves to help you defeat gruntilda and rescue tooty but do you just walk up to gruntilda and save tooty not at all there are several items to collect to defeat gruntilda the most important one is jiggies there are ten jiggies in each world and you need several items to collect them along the way bottles teaches you to use certain items such as eggs to shoot through kazooie 's mouth or how to fly when you collect enough feathers another essential item to collect is mumbo tokens gruntilda has hidden mumbo tokens all around her enormous lair and if you collect enough you can visit the great shaman mumbo jumbo and he will transform you into different creatures to help you along your journey so you have plenty to do in this game i can guarantee that another essential item are music notes in each world one hundred music notes are scattered all around and if you collect enough you can open new doors in gruntilda 's massive lair but i do find it to become quite tedious sometimes why you may ask because each time you leave and re enter a world all the notes are still there no matter how many you 've collected let 's say you 've collected ninety nine out of the hundred possible music notes to collect well if you leave the world and re enter you would have to collect all ninety nine notes again you could n't go searching for the one music note you had n't collected and while yet this situation is highly unlikely it 's still annoying no matter how many notes you have to re collect fortunately if you do n't care about collecting all one hundred music notes you do n't have to because the game automatically saves the amount you 've collected there are n't too many moves to learn in banjo kazooie and it did n't take me long to master them and there are n't many control problems actually the controls are almost perfect but i did get frustrated with a feature that was not added in the game i wish banjo could hang on to ledges there was many times in clanker 's cavern where i could almost reach a ledge   but it was just barely out of reach because i could n't hang on to the ledge while yet this was n't too big of a deal i think that feature could of made the game a little less frustrating i was also very pleased with camera control there are three angles to choose from except in a few rare areas and i found it easy to maneuver i told you this game was made in 1998 right well the graphics are terrific the different atmospheres to this game make it twice more enjoyable you can relax in broad daylight in treasure trove cove or wonder at dark in mad monster mansion and i thought the last world click clock wood was absolutely brilliant it 's a forest and you collect jiggies in the four season 's spring summer fall and winter i especially loved freezeezy peak and it was so much fun climbing the huge snowman i also loved the music in this game each beat is catchy and it never got repetitive for me and the sound effects were great as well ... well the only complaint i could have is that there is no dialogue in the game but i actually found the weird sounds from the characters kind of funny and i loved the insults between kazooie and bottles and gruntilda 's rhymes cracked me up that 's another reason i love this game it has such a charm to it not like some newer games to many games have steered away from being innocent and charming and this game has this quality what more can i say this game is fun to play it has great replay value the music sounds and the worlds all sound and look absolutely fantastic and the difficult final fight with gruntilda at the end was indeed terrific as well it took me thirty hours to complete without a guide and i had so much fun solving puzzles and this game can test your mind at certain times i will admit i did need help online for a few jiggies but the ending sequence makes the occasional frustrations all worthwhile very satisfying if you ask me i 'm now very anxious to play banjo tooie as it 's been claimed to be even better than the original banjo kazooie is highly recommended this game is indeed a classic
banjo kazooie is a strange platformer but ultimately misses the mark in all key areas of being entertaining   it tries to be funny without actually being exciting to play   all the attention on humor and yet the game itself is hardly ever fun   this means children would probaly be able to overlook the games flaws and focus on the humor which i 'm sure was nintendo 's intentions- to market the game for kids and assume they would n't be able to detect the lousy game design   i guess the nintendo 64 struggling to make a profit at the time meant nintendo had to do absolutely anything to try and get any type of crowd interested in their products despite the poor quality we 're forced to persevere so that explains banjo kazooie 's existence anyway banjo kazooie is basically nothing but an item collecting quest with graphics that are admittedly prettier and just better than 90 of the stuff the n64 was pumping out at the time   the waters grassy lands mountains ... everything is a beautiful sight to behold with crystal clear authentically pleasing environments   but seriously why am i basically doing nothing but walking around collecting items the entire time   if you think that 's what all platformers do guess again many of them focus on exciting enemy variety diverse surroundings and a gradual increase in challenge which this game sorely lacks   the only challenge is to avoid falling from high narrow platforms while collecting musical notes- these are dirty tricks and artificial challenges   i found sharks you have to swim away from crabs you can stomp on top of and weird gigantic green enemies that come out of walls while you 're trying to make your way across high paths without falling   these enemies only appear like 10 of the time- the rest of your surroundings are n't very threatening let 's see all the things you have to collect   honeycomb pieces jiggy pieces mandatory to open entrances to new locations and you need to obtain a certain number of them per world 100 musical notes which is a total ripoff of super mario 64 with the 100 coins needed to get a star mumbo tokens used to cast spells and jinjo tokens used to win vehicle parts   you can turn into animals and insects which is somewhat satisfying for the sake of seeing the occasional brief moments of diversity but otherwise nothing to get really excited about   often you have to climb trees to reach the items on top and it gets boring after a while believe me oh and the game is a victim of underwater tragedies- you 're constantly adjusting the camera for a more appropriate angle but finding that it 's much harder than it needs to be   i will never understand why nintendo refuses to fix water portions in 3d platform gaming   it 's mind boggling   they did n't even fix them in super mario galaxy 2 a game released a good 10 years after banjo kazooie   the characters are all forgettable including the ponytail sporting female bear and banjo himself   kazooie the bird is probably the only tolerable one of the bunch whereas the mario series can be enjoyed by kids and adults respectively banjo kazooie is certainly intended solely for children and no other age group   it 's too shallow of a game overall to satisfy adult gamers   banjo kazooie is like walking into the nicest looking restaurant in town and everything is great except for one thing- you get a small quantity of food so you ask yourself is it worth my time to return here again
if you own a n64 and are looking for a game to play go to your local game store and find banjo kazooie in my opinion this game is simply amazing the main plot throughout the game is that banjo the bear and his faithful breegull sidekick kazooie are attempting to rescue banjo 's little sister tootie from the evil witch gruntilda enjoy the game as you explore 10 exciting worlds collect numerous puzzle pieces(open worlds and rescue your sister from the evil clutches of gruntilda
great game
if mario 64 was good than banjo was mario perfected amazing game another gem from years ago that i played start to finish multiple times amazing levels perfect control great but hokey music some people were annoyed by the voices" i thought they were hilarious the camera does get a little crazy here and there but this was 3d platforming in it 's beginning and really the camera is about as perfect as a 3d platforming camera can be to summarize ... great gameplay awesome graphics for the time an ending riddle that had me looking for a way in for weeks on end.(a real bummer that the two games didn't link after all).that 's probably the biggest disappointment that all those mystery areas were never revealed by the n64.otherwise .... another great platformer from the golden age of platforming collect a thons highly recommended
developer rare is a master at infusing originality into their imitations this is n't a knock against them william shakespeare pulled stories and plots from other writers and crafted masterpieces rare is gamedom 's shakespeare in that regard banjo kazooie is obviously influenced by super mario 64 although it 's always unfortunate for a game to be compared to that masterpiece while banjo kazooie lacks super mario 64 's magic and ingenuity it has its own magic that sets it apart from nintendo 's behemoth the good:+ a fun story+ an imaginative use of its characters+ creative worlds to explorethe bad:-- too easy and short-- the few parts that are too hardthe ugly why is kazooie so insulting?story--9/10the first thing that stands out is the dialogue especially of the evil witch gruntilda or grunty who speaks in clever rhymes it 's refreshing all the more that what she says is often funny the game begins with her asking her mirror who is the most beautiful of them all of course it could n't be gruntilda there 's nothing even remotely pretty about a fat green hag the most beautiful of them all is banjo 's younger sister tooty who looks similar to tiny kong of donkey kong fame so grunty sets off to kidnap tooty and succeeds leaving only the mole bottles as a witness bottles must survive a downpour of kazooie 's insults and witticisms to explain the kidnapping to banjo and kazooie the question becomes can banjo and kazooie save tooty before grunty robs her of her beauty and transfers it to herself?gameplay--8/10here is the game 's bane and boon everything else sets it up wonderfully the soundtrack is great the visuals are very nice and the opening story sequence is funny the game controls smoothly and you have plenty of moves to learn and use throughout the levels are varied with plenty of collectibles and other goodies to discover but these levels are so small so short so easy i never spent an hour and a half on any one level and most of them took less than an hour to complete in that time i could collect ten jigsaw puzzle pieces one hundred musical notes and numerous other items such as the mumbo jumbo skulls extra lives and jinjos compared to super mario 64 i ca n't help but say is that all?there are a total of nine worlds as well as a main hub world which is too labyrinthine for its purpose rare goes a little overboard as to the amount of collectibles they expect gamers to gather unless you use cheats it takes 94 out of the 100 jigsaw pieces total to unlock every single world including the final fight with grunty that 's not too difficult as i 'd say about 97 of those jigsaw pieces are a piece of cake more than 880 of the 900 music notes are needed in order to give you somewhat of a chance against the unfairly difficult fight with grunty you just ca n't count on rare to make a strictly children 's game see diddy kong racing).these are mostly criticisms but they comprise a small percent of the game you will spend most of it enjoyably despite the very easy difficulty it is n't boring there 's plenty to explore in the levels and as they go on they become larger and more complex especially the sprawling final level rare flexes all of its creative muscles in that level revolving around the four seasons and even includes a few semi stories with some new characters not that the other levels are clunkers but if only they could provide the same sort of entertainment the rest of the game would have been that much more enjoyable longevity--5/10a game should only be as long as it needs to be but i think banjo kazooie needed to be a little longer considering what nintendo did years earlier in super mario 64 it 's no excuse that rare could n't match that level of magnitude but it 's unfair to compare any game to super mario 64 most gamers will complete this all 100 jigsaw pieces almost all 900 music notes in less than twelve hours after finishing it there 's no reason to go back the cheats only give you infinite resources but what 's the point when you 've already finished the game the only way a game like this can extend its life is for the single player adventure to be a little longer
this is one game that will test your skills on how to figure things out but if you want to take the easy way out you can always get bottles the neer sighted mole 's help one thing i like about this game is that when bottle kazooie confront each other they always throw smack at each other which makes the storyline more funnier this is a pretty cool game it 's worth buying i had fun playing it i will buy it if you liked this game check out all of the other banjo kazooie games
one of the best games on the n64 it combines action adventure puzzle and other elements as you go through awsome based levels to beat it
goldeneye 007 killer instint the donkey kong country series conker diddy kong racing .... those were the good ol' days when rare was still relevant   before they sold their souls to microsoft and lost all credibility   and in my opinion the peak of rare was with the banjo games kazooie tooie on nintendo 64   kazooie to me defines the n64 3-d platformer   while many will say mario 64 which is a near perfect game   i think the nostalgia sometimes forgets how much better banjo kazooie was   back in 98 rare was on a roll   this game was yet another grandslam   a brand new franchise cut from scratch   and it 's absolutely amazing   i wo n't go into all the details and story as my fellow reviewers have already made clear   all i can add is this game is easily one of the best games of the late 90 's   it was a game i picked up and loved immediately   my only question is what the happened to rare   they were so amazing with nintendo then dropped bomb after bomb for the x box consoles   i 'm not a nintendo fanboy so do n't even go there   but rare took a big dookie all over this series with the newer games on microsoft consoles   the 1998 game will always be the best   and i hope someday the brothers who originally ran rare will comeback to bring the infamous banjo threeie to life on any console
positive:+ gameplay is very deep with new elements added all the time+ worlds are very diverse and have a lot of content+ music tracks are great and change in style when you 're in different spots+ sharp controls that work well for the most partnegative:- you have to start your note count every time you re enter a world- camera does n't always give you the best view you needsuper mario 64 revolutionized the 3-d platformer and the amount of people who would deny that are probably fewer than the words in this sentence but when a revolution comes what 's the point of it being so revolutionary unless something comes of it later on in video games a game is a revolution indeed when other games take the basic model and take it to a whole new level and possibly delivering a game that 's even better than the root whether it really is a beneficiary of the beloved mario 64 or rare is just really really good at making games that is where we find banjo kazooie games of the platforming genre are n't exactly known for their amazing stories and banjo fares no different banjo 's little sister tooty is kidnapped by the stereotypical green witch gruntilda she has some sort of weird machine that will supposedly transfer tooty 's beauty to herself and this will leave banjo 's poor sister ugly in the process so banjo and his grumpy bird friend kazooie who for some reason lives in banjo 's backpack set out to gruntilda 's lair to save tooty the story does n't take itself very seriously at all but there 's a great humorous tone to it that more than makes up for the lack of depth the game does n't move from place to place at all the whole thing takes place in gruntilda 's huge lair key word being huge this one location is just so big but perfectly balanced with the ease of traversing that it makes the perfect setting for a platforming game there is a whole lot of variety within the mountain lair with a sewer swamp graveyard and many other spots the areas of different theme will almost always take you to one of the game 's nine worlds which are all big diverse and have a lot of stuff to find you 'll find yourself at a mountain to begin the game then moving on to a beach and later a snow area and haunted mansion like world and so on the game never really runs out of new material to throw at you which is really nice even if most of the themes are found in many other games of the genre too another way banjo always keeps itself fresh is with the moves you can learn in most of the levels you can find a mole named bottles who will teach you a new move if you can find him these moves are sometimes confined to certain spots or items you can put on and they all work together perfectly to make the game progress logically you have to unlock some of these abilities such as flight and invincibility to get deeper into gruntilda 's lair and also to accomplish more in the worlds the game controls very well too even with all the added moves and it does n't get too complicated one issue though is with the camera which you can control the angle of but you still sometimes ca n't get the viewpoint that 's just right for a room or area but the core of the game stays the same no matter how many moves you learn or different worlds you visit the main objects to collect are jiggies which are basically pieces of jigsaw puzzles that when put together open the door to a new world ten of these can be found in each level along with 100 notes which open up doors to new areas of the lair unfortunately the game 's note total is merely a combined high score of how many notes you collect in each level each time you re enter a world the note count restarts this is pretty annoying sometimes and it would have been nice to just keep all the notes so you do n't have to recollect all of them again to advance your total note count thankfully the jiggies are extremely well balanced as far as how hard they are to get in the first world most of them are sitting on the ground like easter eggs but as you progress through the game you have to work much harder to earn your way to more worlds graphically banjo kept up to date well enough the visuals are just a tad choppy but they still look good enough and that sort of thing happened all the time in the n64 era sometimes objects that are a little ways away wo n't appear on screen until you get closer which thankfully does n't prove to be too annoying but still would be good if fixed despite these few flaws though the graphics look great considering the times one of banjo 's shining areas aside from gameplay is the sound the characters speak in a gibberish sort of language with text shown on the bottom of the screen and this might annoy some but it 's still good to add personality to each character the sound effects are all good too no complaints there the really cool part of the sound though is the music the tracks are cool enough as they are but when you 're standing on a different spot or in a different area like if you 're under water or at the entrance to a different world the music style and sound totally changes while keeping the same song then as you exit the spot the music transitions back to the normal style and this effect may sound small without actually hearing it but trust me when i say it 's really really cool mario 64 may have been the revolution but some of the games that derived bits and pieces from it were possibly even better in my opinion banjo kazooie is one such game adding a lot of depth and value to an already proven formula it may not be the game everyone looked to for inspiration in the game making world but banjo kazooie is a real gem from rare 's glory days on the n64 and it makes me want to play the sequel even if it is ten years old gameplay 9.5graphics 8.5sound 9.5camera control 8.5value 9.5final score 9.2/10
banjo kazooie is a game i 've played many times since i got it in the early 2000s and while its fun its not the most entertaining game i 've played there 's two main objectives in banjo kazooie hunting and gathering you hunt for these jigsaw pieces called jiggys to help you complete jigsaw puzzles to open worlds you gather all sorts of items within each level like musical notes jinjos mumbo tokens feathers etc this concept gets boring after awhile but nevertheless the game is pretty fun as a whole i 'd recommend the sequel banjo tooie instead as its 10 times more entertaining
all in all this is the best platform game that i have played in a long time of course it follows the basic formula of a platformer kidnapped female evil castle jump on enemies etc but the reason the formula still exists is due to the fact that occasionally it works really well banjo kazooie is a case where the cliche works to perfection although we question nintendo 's blatant violation of the genetic cloning ban put in place by the president they did so for a good cause and a damn good game
like super mario and donkey kong this game is a classic the good gameplay and graphics pay off   this is worth the money
banjo kazooie is one of my favorite games and it works perfectly after all these years and being shipped around the country perfect
this game is fantastic personally i love it have you ever played a game where an evil witch is ugly and wants to be evil so she steals a beautiful girl named tooty to try and transfer the beauty to the ugly witch also have you ever played a game where a bear and bird have to collect golden puzzle pieces musical notes dinosaurs mixed with teddy bears named jinjos also have you ever played a game where a shaman transforms the bear and bird into various forms well if you have n't this is where to start this game is perfect for all ages i would recommend this game to anyone who has a n64
i 've never really had enough of an attention span to play collect the item games but this particular one is really great it has enough action and puzzle involved to hold the attention of even a gamer like me with honestly and unfortunately a terribly short attention span for hours at a time with enough elements of finding things you 'll need later to keep you playing and replaying each level a truly great game and i wish more of the sort were made these days i feel way too young to be saying this but they just do n't make them like this anymore!on a side note the cartridge i received has some ... interesting connections i 'd guess the previous owner loved and played it as much as i do haha
this is one of the best games out there it 's a classic banjo kazooie is one of the rarest and hard to find games ever the story is really good a witch kidnaps a beautiful girl and wants to be the prettiest of them all her brother and his pal kazooie have to save her while its a relatively easy it can still be hard in some places and there are cheat codes to help you along the way with things like gold feathers red feathers and eggs however if you quit and save your game then the cheat has to be reentered while the game does have it 's flaws its still really fun to play the game essentially is very easy next to its sequel game banjo tooie the levels all relatively easy however it is very easy to die in this game on top of that like other reviewers on amazon have said about dying and losing notes and recollecting them is toldly true clarkers cavern was the worst because you only have 6 things of air and have to get extra air from a fish blowing bubbles the level that is the most challenging of them all was click clock wood because of going from the changing seasons and having to grab notes from all seasons that was tough for me however the most challenging and difficult part of this game is beating grunty herself that is the most challenging part of this game because you have to hit her with eggs and unfortunately its a huge flaw on rare 's part for not putting a homing shooter like they do in the sequel game overall despite it 's many flaws nintendo and rare have done an excellent job making a game that is graphically pleasing and the gameplay is awesome buy it you wo n't regret it
this is one of my all time favorite games the characters are likeable with hilarious dialogue and an intriguing story also the music is some of the best i 've ever heard in a video game also the graphics and sound are great for n64 the controls are crazy precise for n64 and man is this game challenging there are lots of secrets to uncover and special power ups to unlock if only microsoft had n't ruined rare ...
now that banjo kazooie is over five years old a sequel now exist and there is likely another game coming hopefully the game only for the n64 is one of the most amazing platformers ever in fact it 's one of the most amazing games in any genre period it took a while to beat the game but it was well worth it if your not familiar with b k let me explain .. banjo is a bear with a handy backpack kazooie is a bird who hangs out in banjo 's backpack with the many special moves kazooie pops out of the pack quite a bit together they work through many huge levels collecting items like puzzle pieces 100 hidden through out the entire game musical notes 100 on each level little jinjo people 5 on each level there are also mumbo skulls to find they allow you once you have the required amount to change form you must visit the mumbo skull guy quite often changing form is mandatory for instance b k can not fit into some smaller places turning into an ant allows you to go into a small hole where prizes are not reachable otherwise vast and adventurous b k is impossible to dislike even if your not a fan of platformers even if your just watching it 's entertaining i 'll give you an idea of how effective the story is banjo kazooie is the wizard of oz of vidoe games
i have never played anything like this since everything from sly   racoon to ratchet and clank owe it to this wicked witch gruntilda takes banjo 's sister to hey layer miles away in a realistic 3d cartoon world banjo is a bear with kazooie a bird in his backpack that can help him jump and fly and basically you learn to do lots of things with it you solve puzzles via action and collect tolkens across lovely maps mumbo jumbo transforms banjo into some other creatures along the way you can fly it was amazing a full adventure all the way to end we played it for months and i have never played anything like it again the makers of donkey kong released it at the best time it is now up to the future generations to make adventure concepts better than this one this is one of the best n64 games ever
there is not much i can say except this is the best game for n64 not too easy not too hard tons of levels and objectives and the cutest cast of characters jinjos rock if you like adventure games banjo kazooie is for you
banjo kazooie is an action adventure game in the style of super mario 64 however it is similar yet also quite different rather than having most of the skills you need at the beginning of the game you learn a few in the very beginning and then learn the remaining skills throughout the first six worlds there are nine but they are much larger than the fifteen in mario 64 notes are like coins and jiggies are like stars however rather than six stars in each world there are 10 jiggies to find in each world and 10 in the witch 's castle much like the castle secret stars also you can transform in five of the nine massive levels with the help of the crazy witch doctor mumbo jumbo generally it will help you get at least 1 jiggy in the world and they can do things that banjo and kazooie ca n't on their own throughout the game you get to transform into a termite level 1 an alligator level 4 a walrus level 5 a pumpkin level 7 and a bee level 9).the nine massive worlds are each very different from eachother but how fun are they well they 're all very fun to play in mainly because the tunes in each world really match the mood from eerie funeral dirges to peppy shipyard music this game has that and then some overall i highly recommend it if you read my previous review of the game banjo tooie you 'd see why i enjoyed the sound effects so much once more i highly recommend this game
this was purchased as a christmas gift for my daughter but since she was home for the holiday week end i had her check it out   everything works great
after rareware turned goldeneye into a system seller for the nintendo 64 it broke out again with the action platformer banjo kazooie an ugly old witch named gruntilda has taken banjo 's sister tootie and plans to suck the beauty out of her banjo and kazooie the bird that lives in his backpack must brave gruntilda 's fortress to get tootie back the plot is a little sugary and kiddie but it 's really just an excuse to send gamers on a mario 64-style adventure where completing tasks and puzzles in worlds will open up new worlds to explore yes it 's pretty much a clone of mario but at the same time it refines and enhances the mario formula players have more unique special moves at their disposal and these are much more essential to navigating the environment and solving puzzles worlds are beautiful creative and expansive tossing you into a room with a giant shark a huge snowman or a forest where you can actively move between the seasons it 's all topped by memorable music that changes to fit the environment fades or grows louder depending on where you are in the stage this is a game that has aged gracefully yes it 's on an old system but the art design and music still hold up well like the classic mario titles and gameplay is solid a masterful experience that s supplemented quite well by its sequel banjo tooie
omgosh   my son .. grandson .. and great grandson all three are totally enjoying this game soooooo much   i 'm not any kind of a game player but it makes me feel so good just watching their enjoyment   thank you for a product that is not full of all that blood and gore that so many of the games have now days
banjo kazooie is a game that did n't really appeal to me at first   it looked to childish to easy and just basically stupid   comming from the   epic company rareware i was a bit more interested in what this game was   about   seeing so many good reviews and so many possitive aspects i   realized i must give this game a try   well was i ever lucky to do so   keeping with the mario 64 type control style and the amazing graphics i   could n't put the game down   even though the game was kiddie looking and   very childish too it was really placed for us people who love adventure   games   the little things such as the mini games make this game even   better than it already was   imagine running around in the snow in a race   against a sleding polar bear or playing follow the leader with a giant   ghost hand   these are only a few of the things you can do in the game   the game flows a little different than mario fans might be used to you   have many things to collect   for starters your main objective is to find   all the jiggys on a level so you can gain access to all other levels   also music notes are needed to break the witches spell on doors throughout   her lair   and even little guys called jinjo 's are here for you to collect   so they can help you on your journey through a forest islands deserts   and many other worlds   if you have seen a rare game you know that they   have good graphics so no exception here very well done   the music is   also a plus feature on this game   with so many great reviews by people of   all ages and sexes you would be doing yourself a great disjustice by not   buying this game
rareware words fail me again they have made a quality title beyond imagination creative beyond a shadow of a doubt 95 of people agree that banjo kazooie is a landmark title with everything the n64 has to offer and that it is worthy of 5 out of 5 stars while developed early in n64 's lifespan the graphics stand out beyond many titles recently released the sound is equally as impressive for n64 and the game has been cleverly melded with it to make you feel as the atmosphere of the game has changed depending on your situation i am proud to say many people love this game many of my friends still play it occasionally however few have beaten it all the way this game is solid for 50 hours of gaming but only when you are willing to get every last puzzle piece and musical note and every other item some people dislike it and do not be fooled a 27 year male old who listens to ultra hard rock and loves games with extreme violence and/or nudity will not like this game it is by no means for everybody many gamers from preschool to high school will like it but not everybody the controls are easy enough to master and any avid or casual gamer will easily master them with a little practice the sound is superb the graphics are good for an n64 title there is not a dull moment in this game and the attention to detail is amazing the puzzles the meat of the game are easy enough for older kids to have a challenge and not to hard for younger kids the puzzle peices your reward for completeing a puzzle are well hidden the musical notes the only way to advance to the next portion of the overworld are challenging to find the most fun part of the game visiting mumbo is quite enjoyable he transforms you into various forms a fat walrus a termite and even a bumble bee there is n't really an advancing story but that 's okay you get an occasional cinematic but it 's pretty basic the story goes ... the evil witch gruntilda is happily hanging out atop her mountain when ... the cute tootie sister of banjo the bear strolls by overcome with jealousy she sees tootie is quite a bit cuter than her so she kidnapps banjo 's sister and creates a machine to suck tootie 's cuteness out and put it into her banjo and his sidekick breegull kazooie set off to find tootie a mole named bottles helps them learn some new moves to defeat various obsticles in the game well i hope you enjoy this game thanks for reading this review and until next time ... crimson|red
many people believe that this is a copy of super mario 64 i have played super mario 64 ds and i must say that for the most part they are correct the only thing different from this game is the puzzle finding element to the game if you are into strategy and action games the two games you should have in mind are super mario 64 and banjo kazooie but suppose you could only take one which would you purchase both are almost the same if you like games where you have to think and games that are tedious both are for you overall since banjo kazooie makes you think quite a bit more and has the extra puzzle finding feature to it i would suggest you pick up banjo kazooie first and then either get banjo tooie if you truly enjoyed the first game or get super mario 64 if you want to play a slightly different video game also banjo kazooie is a lot easier than super mario 64 so when you go to the store to pick which of the two games to buy remember that unless you have a lot of free time on you hands you probably should n't buy super mario 64
not one of the best games i would have rather played mario just once i only play it for about two minutes i fall asleep afterward
this is the best n64 game ever made next to the wonderful ocarina of time.i beat everything in it when i was 9-i collected all the jinjos got all the puzzle pieces etc.i bought it when i was 8.it 's an amazing fun game.i just feel tormented that i had to use the players guide to beat the 2nd banjo tooie.i try not to think about it.but this game is extremly hard and grueling but in a good way.the levels are extremly detailed and fun.my favorite is the graveyard haunted house level.(i forgot it 's name.)buy it.i command you
when i looked for the game i was looking for this for a tear play station 3 the view on this game i liked when i received it was not discovered for version 3 but 2.i am very upset
i 'm so glad i was able to buy this game at a great price i really enjoyed reliving my childhood
first off i 've only owned two crash games the first crash bandicoot and wrath of cortex for the ps1 i played a demo for warped on my spyro the dragon game and wanted it ever since i bought it on amazon and its safe for me to say that ... this is the crash i know and love!^_^for those who do n't know crash bandicoot first came out in the 90 's as a standard straight forward platformer you 're a mutated bandicoot named crash who escapes from the evil mad scientist dr neo cortex and must go back to save your girlfriend in warped dr. cortex now works for uka uka the brother of aku aku an evil mask that wants to destroy crash and take over the world he instructs cortex to go through time and collect crystals and gems that hold extreme power crash has to literally race through time and jump spin and dance his way through time to retrieve them before cortex gets ahold of them this game is just as fun as the first one it brought me back to a time where video games concentrated more on gameplay and content rather than graphics which games today seem to concentrate almost too much on the controls are spot on you can build momentum for jumps move in any direction and really i never had problems with the controls even in the first crash one thing i really love about this one is that i do n't feel bad when i die this game has some really interesting death scenes rather you 're forcibly kissed by a frog that changes into a prince eaten by lions thrown into the screen by a two headed fat person or so on when i finish the game i plan on seeing how many ways i can die some worlds replicate each other but are harder and take more and more skill to get through the boss battles are really diverse and take strategy timing and skill to get rid of i must confess i found the first boss and 2 worlds extremely easy its not until the 3 that the game just goes f this i 'm gon na make your time a living hell its still way easy so far compared to the first game though which really did what i said above i also noticed something that first caught my attention in wrath of cortex the game seems extremely open when it comes to lives seriously i 'm not even half way through the game and all ready up to 50 almost i guess i 'm that good at playing i m definately buying the second one i admit i 'm disappointed at the way the turn the series have made i wish they kept it as a patformer and just added maybe some adventure elelments to it like they did twinsanity even though its glitchy as hell naughty dog where did you go crash bandicoot warped is just what i expected it to be its funny addicting challenging and overall just shows graphics do n't make the game but its content and gameplay
this is one of my favorite games of all time   in this game there are 30 different levels that are mostly composed of the same 3d crash levels that we 're used to some levels however you get to use a biplane motorcycle or jet ski like the previous versions of crash you have to collect crystals and gems   now you can also collect a relic for having the best time   the music is fun the controls are easy and it 's just an overall great game for any age
i am shocked and very pleased to report that crash bandicoot 3 warped is a drastic improvement over the original crash bandicoot as you may have heard i am definitely not a fan of the very first crash bandicoot game released for the sony playstation in 1996   i am however incredibly surprised to find that crash bandicoot 3 warped is actually a really fun adventure game that may have been slightly overlooked at the time of its release because of the seemingly never ending amount of wonderful games released for the playstation in 1998.just so you know i ca n't compare warped to crash bandicoot 2 cortex strikes back because i have n't played that one   i can only compare warped to the original crash bandicoot before playing crash 3 i was almost certain that crash bandicoot was an overrated video game character because my first and only exposure to crash was the very first game   i thought for sure crash bandicoot was either a mario or an earthworm jim rip off and did n't deserve all the attention it got for 10 years the original was the only crash bandicoot game i knew and truth be told it was a pretty average game because every stage featured basically the same uninspiring repetitive island environment where the object was to run to the end of every stage collecting berries and smashing all the boxes as a way to earn more lives and receive a better overall percentage simply put crash 's very first outing was boring   it desperately needed variety   walking through island jungle stages all the time can only provide so much fun before it inevitably gets boring   the creators of crash bandicoot must have realized how boring this formula was because warped does just the opposite- warped features nothing but creativity   in warped every stage certainly does not have the same feel   you will encounter something drastically different in every stage   i like that the main objective of crash bandicoot 3 warped is to find the purple gem found in each of the 25 stages of the game   you have to find all 25 purple gems otherwise the game wo n't allow you to fight the boss at the end of the world you 're in   for example if you 're in world 4 and ca n't find the purple gem in stage 3 you wo n't be allowed to face the boss at the end of that world   you 're stuck there until you find that darn purple gem   once you find the gem and face and defeat the boss you move on to the next world and repeat the process of collecting one purple gem per level and face the boss   by the way there 's 5 worlds total and 5 stages in each world   that comes to 25 stages total the amount of creativity that went into each of the 25 stages is simply incredible   unlike the first crash bandicoot game where you mainly just spin around through a jungle environment breaking boxes and jumping over cracks in the ground warped offers a lot more in the way of variety   in warped you will encounter a few motorcycle racing stages where you 're required to get first place so you can receive the purple gem a couple underwater stages with very neat looking backgrounds and deadly puffy fish swimming about a couple levels where you 're steering an airplane and required to shoot down blimps and other airplanes and not to mention those tricky tiger riding stages oh and i have to mention the ultra cool futuristic robot stages which require near perfect jumping patterns in order to complete   the jet ski stages are really fun because you 're located on top of the ocean and i guarantee you will have the time of your life jumping over ramps while avoiding those floating bombs   yup it 's awesome   this is what makes crash bandicoot 3 so great- you wo n't know what to expect until you enter the level probably the worst thing about crash bandicoot 3 warped is the fact that the game offers little in the way of challenge   that 's not to say the game is a cakewalk either   people who think warped is an easy game are only comparing the challenge to the previous two crash bandicoot games   if you compare warped to say i do n't know spyro the dragon it 's not such an easy game then   it 's definitely not a hard game either   you will beat it   i think the challange is comparable to super mario bros. 1 the old nes classic the one thing i find challenging in warped is the boss battle in world 3 where you 're required to jump over bombs and laser beams heading in your direction   this is one case where practice does n't necessarily make perfect   also the second airplane stage can be a challenge if you do n't bother shooting down the enemy planes one thing about crash bandicoot 3 warped that is incredibly easy is the object of finding those purple gems   most of the time you can not miss those gems because you basically walk right into them on your way to reaching the end of the stage   i mean they are always right there   right in front of you!after you complete a stage you can always go back to it and the computer will then give you a new option to complete the level in a certain amount of time   finishing the stage in a certain amount of time is actually quite hard   it means you really have to take off running and not stop for a single moment to smash a box or spin attack an enemy or anything   it means you have to run run run   just so you know completing the stages under a certain time is not a requirement   it 's entirely up to you if you 'd like to accept the challenge   i 'm too much of a wimp to accept it personally i like how you can save your game after you complete a stage   you can actually complete one stage and go to the save room if you wish   very convenient   oh and get this- if during the middle of the game you decide you want to stop playing and shut off the playstation when you come back to the game later all the lives you collected up to that point will still be there   i ca n't think of any other game that will save all the lives you collect   speaking of lives they are so easy to find in warped that you probably can collect up to 45 of them   that 's a lot and you will probably need them because even though the challenge ranges from low to medium your first time through the game wo n't be that simple when crash gets hit or smashed by something i think it 's funny the way he yells whoa   it reminds me of that comedian carrot top the reason crash bandicoot 3 warped is n't going to receive a 5-star rating from me is because of the same problem found in spyro the dragon- in the flying stages in this case the airplane stages when you hit down on the d pad the airplane flies up and hitting up will make the airplane go down   the game company made the direction the wrong way   oops   at least when you steer the airplane left it will go left   the same with right   unfortunately many game makers have made and continue to make the same mistake   it needs to be corrected once and for all i realize having your airplane fly up when you hit down on the d pad is an example of realism since that 's more or less how real airplanes operate but the thing is crash bandicoot is n't supposed to be about realism since it 's just a platform adventure game and furthermore it still does n't change the fact that up and down are reversed   this adds unncessary frustration and challenge in learning something that definitely feels backwards there 's a toxic underwater stage in donkey kong country 3 where the controls are reversed as a way to add challenge and in my mind at least having the controls reversed when trying to operate the airplane in this game definitely falls under the same category of unnecessary challenge i hope you buy this game for your sony playstation and experience a fun time
crash is my favorite videogame character .. i remember playing it when it first came out with my sister on the ps1 waaaaay back .... this is so fun i love this game just buy itttt
once again crash bandicoot takes a big step up to greatness crash bandicoot 3 warped was fantastic it was even better than the second one better graphics story music and gameplay the enemies were fun just like in the first one and the new vehicles available were awesome like the bi planes space fighter pura the tiger and the jet ski also it was n't as difficult to gather the crystals and gems as it was in the second part the environments were better and the new powers that crash bandicoot acquires are totally awesome the super belly flop speed shoes death tornado spin attack and the totally awesome fruit bazooka this is definitely one of the best of the games in the crash bandicoot trilogy you crash fans must get this game
i ca n't even begin to explain how much i love this game as well as the second crash bandicoot game(i have n't played the first game yet because they are so much fun with lots and lots of humorous levels and disasters bandicoot is a marsupial on a muey dangerouso quest to collect 25 crystals and 25 relics in a quest to stop dr. neo cortex and aku akus evil twin uka uka 's quest to take over the world there are so many things that make this game so addictive,.1 the music it 's so hilarious2 the complex levels3 the graphics are so awesome4 the way crash dies i.e. falling off screen and his shoes fly up and fall back down being sucked into a giant spinning vase and the lid closes on top of it)by god to really even explain how great this game really is is difficult for me like sonic the hedgehog was for sega and mario was for nintendo crash is for the playstation in this day and age of excessively bloody and violent video games the crash bandicoot series is a great sigh of relief i tend to enjoy sillier cartoonish games like this i will never tire of this game
ca n't review this title now cuz i still have n't officially finished crash 's 1&2 i bought it to have i 'm a classic game collector at heart do n't know when i 'll start playing but i will eventually now that it 's in my library
crash bandicoot warped orange cool creative fuzzy neat great graphics awesome design introduction of secret levels for the series power ups new bosses including a big boss and a new playable character   these things are what make this a major improvement on the two previous games   crash 1 was a breakthrough crash 2 opened up a new world and this game completely blows it all away   this was how i got hooked on crash bandicoot   i played this and loved it   i recommend it
graphics 10/10 the best visuals of the series the colours shine fantastically and it all looks stunningly beautiful the characters are clear and the game has backgrounds i could feast on sound 9/10 great uses of evil voicing and fantastic sound editing detail makes crash 3 's sound get a notch up value 10/10 you 'll be begging for more!overall 10/10 fantastically detailed game that mixes genres and characters into a big story that erupts with fabulous enjoyment in short buy it
all right for the guys that hate to read a lot about real quick if you like 3d platform action adventure titles and maybe you like cb just one thing get it!!!!!!!!!.ok now to business i have been in the world of video games since atari 2600 and colecovision so after more than 20 years of gaming i know of what i am talking about if i say its worth is worth it but the final word is always yours game play:+++++this game has everything you need for hours of high quality of gaming experience the art concept of the game goes over expectations of the hardware limitation of the pso the design of every single element in the game is very creative and unique the developers invested time on the comedy of the game which is a tradition on the original trilogy as usual the controller its a wonder no need to struggle controlling the character and it vibrates as well the powers the moves and the style of the main character cb its superb every part of the game becomes fun not repeatable pattern of enemies or levels the game itself has a lot of extras for a replay definitely an outstanding game!!!!!.difficulty:!@#$% platinum relics)curse frustration but with practice you might become a cb3w masterplot:+++well do not expect a twisted chrono trigger plot as always in crash games the lack of plot its compensated with a beautiful work in the software itself basically crash goes trough a set of portals using n cortex once again his back with an ally own technology through time and space the main thing is of course stop them!!.graphics:*****this is the strongest part of the game no doubt the game is programmed to utilize most of the potential of the pso gpu they managed to create excellent crystal effects water light sources and shiny surfaces like chrome and ice one of the few games that deserve to be owned forever unopened one the few great looking games for pso.overall:*****perfect over all score once again if you thing you can beat the game with one hand attached at your back and with folded eyes try getting beyond 100 and all the platinum relics the real gamer and fans of the series did it look for it on you tube so the difficulty is very acceptable this is by far the best crash bandicoot game by far since i personally thing that going trough naughty dog to travelers tales lost a bit of formula of this great franchise but oh well see yas
well let&#8217;s end the crash bandicoot trilogy on playstation with crash bandicoot 3 warped this game was released in 1998 and was once again developed by naughty dog published by sony computer entertainment and distributed by universal interactive studios it was originally a playstation exclusive but was later re released as a ps one classic on the playstation store the game&#8217;s story takes place immediately after the events of the second game in which the ruins of the cortex vortex come crashing down to earth and lands on a temple unleashing an evil entity known as uka uka who is aku aku&#8217;s evil twin brother aku aku is the mask that helped crash out in the first two games uka uka joins with doctor neo cortex and doctor nefarious tropy as they plan to gather crystals in their original places in time and use their energy to enslave the earth the game is once again a platformer with pretty much the same kind of controls as the second game you can not only play as crash but also as his sister coco who was a supporting character in the second game you travel back and forward in time to gather the 25 crystals from the previous game in their original places in time before the enemy does but don&#8217;t worry the levels are completely different from each the second game the game takes place in the time twisting machine which acts as the hub area of the game the machine is split into five chambers with only the first chamber being available at the start each chamber has five buttons that open portals to different levels the goal is the same as the second game obtain the crystal hidden in the area some crystals can be obtained in the middle of the level or by completing a certain task such as winning a race the gems are also back and can only be obtained by destroying all the boxes or completing a hidden level or task once you obtain the five crystals in a chamber a sixth button will appear that warps you to a boss who will fight you in order to get the crystals back by defeating the boss the next chamber will become available to play by defeating a boss you unlock a new power there&#8217;s the super slam which makes your body slam more powerful the double jump a tornado twister which lets you glide for a short period a bazooka launcher which can be used to destroy crates or enemies or collect fruit and one ups and the running shoes which allow you to sprint the newest main feature in the game is the 8220;relics&#8221 which can only be retrieved in a time trail mode for every level in the game after you obtain a level&#8217;s crystal you can go back to the level and collect the yellow clock at the beginning to start a time trail the goal is to reach the end as fast as you can but there are some differences there are yellow time boxes that when destroyed will stop the clock for a short period of time there are no checkpoint boxes so if you die you have to start the level from the beginning but there are plenty of aku aku masks to help you and that&#8217;s pretty much it it proves to be very challenging and getting the platinum relics is insanely difficult and even i never managed to get all of them this game proves to be the best one in the entire series and one of my favorite games overall period i would highly recommend getting this game off the playstation store for 6 this is a must play it really is one of the best final rating   10 out of 10
i 'm a big crash fan and got this game the christmas it came out this game is incredible its easy enough for young kids about 6 or 7 or even really experienced gamers age depending it has very good graphics for a ps1 game and you can use the dual shock or regular controls in this unlike former crash games you use more devices than before and in some levels are actually coco crash 's intelligent little sister for example baby tiger ridden by cocobaby t rex ridden by crashjet ski mobile ridden by cocomotorcycle ridden by crashfast moving spaceship ridden by cocobi plane with guns ridden by crash and coco level depending)underwater jet ski mobile ridden by crashadditionaly you get to fight other bosses and defeating each boss earns you a special item there are 5 in all.#1 super body slam lets you break through protected crates)#2 double jump allows you to jump over higher obstacles)#3 tornado spin spins around wildly helps you glide over bigpits)#4 fruit bazooka a giant gun that can blast away your enemies!)#5 speed shoes gives you power to run used to get certain relics)the final thing crystals gems colored gems and relicscrystals right on the path for normal levels they 're thin and pink touch them and you 've obtained them just beat the level to earn one after you pick them up one per normal level gems to get these break all the boxes in the level sometimes you 'll have to have earned a color gem to get a gem 1 to 2 per normal level colored gems 5 in all one every 5 levels 25 normal levels 5 secret levels they serve as platforms to new areas in some levels to get them ride on a platform in some levels for the platform to appear you have to not have died up to that platform one in a level every 5 levels relics a new addition after you get the relic in the level go back and get the relic by going as fast as you can through the level and getting a certain time there are three types sapphire -- the basic you can get this with no speed shoes gold------more advanced most level you need speed shoes platinum -- expert level extremely hard to aquire lots of practice needed!that 's pretty much all that you need to know all i can say is besides the tips have fun
i would say this is one of the the best ps1 games ever i play it on my ps3.it is fun from riding a tiger to running around spinning bad guys this is child friendly but also adults love it it has good graphics good gameplay good ideas and lots of levels and replay value get this you wo n't miss out
what is it a such a funny game than sonic you konw that fighting with cortex is bad idea because his boss have came uka uka the evil twin brother of aku aku aku aku is good hearted mask man who can help crash for his mission now you can counter boss in each level such in castle area you will encounter tiny tiger can i tell you how to reach boss finsh all levels bring pink cristals to get rid of all stages but each places contains these things and when you collect in each five warps cotians boss when you collect all of then than see six stage will apper kill each boss to unlock anthother warp room near your fisrt warp room now can i tell you about boss in frist warp room cotians tiny tiger then in second warp room cotains dinogldile boss then in thrid warp room cotains dr.n.trophy then in fourth warp contains n.gin then in fiveth warp room contains dr.cortex and uka uka this warp rooms where made by dr n.trophy master of times and it is not gene
this is the third game in the main series of crash bandicoot this game has outstanding gameplay and visuals it 's a crash game so you should know it 's good so here are the final results of the review graphics 9/10 or 4/5sound 8/10 or 3/5gameplay 10/10 or 5/5this game is also the seventh best selling playstation game
after passing the second and then the first i was attempted to do this one the graphics are much better than the previous two but the story got very boring the adventures too became very uninteresting regarding saving and hidden place this one is by far the simplest the story here continues from where it ended in the last part if you have won that is as oppose to aku aku we see the evil uka uka who is the big boss of dr cortex and we see that crash is forced to fight them why why to save the world of course!in the previous 2 parts we had gems now this was not enough for the overactive designers they introduce trophies in this new part for a trophy you have to finish a level within an allotted time this is not that difficult but you can not achieve it in every levels some levels are extremely difficult to finish fast i picked all the gems and all but on trophy and imagine my frustration if you are a crash fan you might like this one but you can not help being disappointed
crash bandicoot warpedi have always loved the crash bandicoot series the original three on the playstation were good and the ones that would follow were always decent i went back to play this classic and discovered it was just as great as i remembered still it does have its low points graphics- 8/10on the original playstation these graphics were fairly good the characters look blocky at points but it sort of adds to the appeal voice syncing is pretty well done levels and characters are interestingly designed the fact that most levels have another level that looks similar does n't really bother me they change the levels up enough to where it feels like you are playing a different level story- 3/10this is the part of the game that is a huge letdown neo cortex our antagonist starts the game off exactly like he was left on the second game ... falling from the sky after failing to stop crash bandicoot from capturing all of the powerful crystals he plummets from his exploding spaceship and falls into a mountain inside of the mountain just so happens to be uka uka a powerful witch mask that appears to have been giving cortex orders all along uka uka was trapped in the mountain by aku aku to keep the world safe now uka uka has escaped with cortex uka uka quickly recruits dr. n. trophy to build him a time machine so he can find the crystals before crash bandicoot was even around this honestly does n't sound too bad until you see crash and his friends at home aku aku hears uka uka 's evil laugh and senses danger then you suddenly appear at the time machine that cortex is using and now you are using it what happened to cortex i have no idea how did you find your way there who knows from there you use the time machine to get to the crystals before cortex sound- 8/10i love the music in this game every level type has different music and it works for every level if you are in an underwater level you will hear mysterious sounding music they just did the music very well the voice acting is top notch as well sound effects are the same old crash bandicoot sounds though it 's not the best video game sound but it 's still really good gameplay- 9/10gameplay can make or break a game luckily the gameplay made this game they added more variety than any of the previous games in the series crash bandicoot is basically a side scroller except the camera is behind crash instead on the side you are still on a fixed path that you have to follow sometimes you will even enter a part of the stage that is a side scroller the gameplay has always work very well like this warped is the third game in the series though and they needed to add something new they did just that by adding power ups flying levels underwater levels jet ski levels and motorcycle racing levels power ups are gained whenever you defeat a boss you get small things like double jump and belly flop at first later on you 'll get a laser guided bazooka and running shoes which really change up the gameplay one thing that i am happy about is that the power ups actually help you play the game they are n't just useless add onsthe new level types are just what this game series needed the underwater levels play like a side scroller underwater it 's enjoyable to swim around instead of walking jet ski and motorcycle levels are great vehicle levels i admit that the controls on the motorcycle levels take some getting used to but that is what makes it fun the flying levels are probably the coolest new things there are only three in the entire game you fly around in a plane and shoot down opposing planes there is n't much to it but it 's a nice break from the other levels difficulty- 5/10 note- this is how much i like the difficulty)this game is extremely easy you can go through the entire game without dying not just that but the entire game only consists of around 3 4 hours of your time one strong afternoon of playing and you 'll be done the bosses on this game can become a little difficult but it only takes a few minutes to learn their pattern also i felt the final boss battle was too easy overall- 7/10the gameplay is extremely strong the story for this game is just all out of whack if you are looking for a quick game to pick up and play this is for you i suggest checking out the previous two titles first though they arecrash bandicootandcrash bandicoot 2 they are better games in my opinion
this game takes months to get 100 completion the new feature in this is getting time rellicks(by doing level fast)and swimming in crash 1 you get balders after you sometimes in crash 3 you get a dinosaur i prefered being chased by a balder and when it squashed crash it went into the screen but you do n't get it in this buy this if you want a platformer(after crash 1 and 2
the crash games for playstion are very fun games even better than the mario games out of the crash seires i think this one is the best there are alot of thing you can do and the bosses rock the story line is the best in this game it takes plase after crash2 were dr cortex ship falles down on a temple wich releses a demon mask the mask that pertected crash in the first two games stats talking and tells crash that the evil mask is his brother and his plan to build a time machine to get crystles todestroy earth the replay vaule is high and the gamplay is fun you wo n't be able to put this game down for awile
this game is great you go through 5 different time portales each one has five different levels in it and at the end you face a boss what you have to do is collect the colored gem and the crystal guess what it 's not as easy as it sounds this game pits you against tons of different enemies appropriate to the level the only thing that takes a star away from this game is the fact that level ideas are repeated for example there are two different water levels with not much difference oh one more thing press up up down down left right left right square at the title page to get a playable demo of spyro the dragon   this is a great game for anyone who likes playstation
the original crash game was very hard to beat   it was still classic   then crash 2 came out with several hard levels and tough bosses   then out came this one crash warped   this is the cult classic of the series   i have beaten the entire game and never once been disappointed because of too much or too little challenge i even managed to get a 104 file with the help of my brother and a twerp i know   there are two secret levels   they are eggipus rex and hot coco   to get to eggipus rex   you go into time trails in the dino might level   then board the yellow gem platform   keep running until you find the second pterydactyl the triceratops will be already chasing you and let it take you away   to get into the hot coco level simply crash into the road sign with an alien on it in the road crash level   this game is a classic and every ps one or ps2 owner needs to have it   was this review helpful of course it was
i played this game at a cousins house but i do nt play games as long as i use to any more i love the level when i play as his sister and ride a tiger
even though this game is so good i think you should get spyro 1 first spyro the dragon gets you to a demo that leads to this i know you 'll like it if you have spyro 1 then try the demo!that is what i did
let me tell you all about this great game i would n't want to give the story away but let me tell you the original two are no match for this great game this game has 30 new colorful and nice levels and 2 hidden ones almost all of them have nice and pretty graphics there are more features too for one thing there is the time trial mode in which you go through the levels in a certain amount of time and you will get relics you can play as coco riding her adorable tiger pura a jetski a blimp and a couple more crash himself can do some more things like a super belly flop a double jump a triple spin use speed shoes and use a fruit bazooka for long range attacks also he can ride an airplane a motorcycle a baby t rex and more also even dying is humorous now for the game 's one flaw it is hard to be challenged however there are 3 types of relics if you get all of the sapphire relics you can get a really good ending if you get all the gold relics you get 105 but the platinum relics require a master to collect so if you like all that 's said and even if you did n't you will definitely love it
this is a very good game it is very challenging it has lots of levels and i managed to get 104 but the ps2 crash is more challenging but the bad thing of the ps2 crash is that the loading takes more than 3 minutes
i got this game when i was like .. 6 years old and i still play it(i'm 14 now.)i think all the crash bandicoots were a new cahnge for psx and i hope that they continue to stick with psx
this is a great game i played this all the time when i was younger and had to have it now as an adult play it all the time
this is a more than ok game not the best but good if you like the quot;spyro&quot series you'll like this for sure the gameplay control sound etc are all like the first 2.the only problem is it 's easy.really really easy the levels are about 5 minutes long each and the total gameplay span is about 7 hours but still that s better than it being hard it 's still pretty fun and stays true to the first 2.and crash 's little sister premires in it here 's the review graphics:4/5sound:5/5music:3/5fun:4/5control d pad:3/5analog:5/5overall:4/5hould you buy it?:yep
this is the best platform game i 've played and eliminates all down sides of its two prequels   you 're a bandicoot and jump on spin baddies you encounter   this game is kind of like old mario games but has awesome graphics   they 've added a type of box to the prequel and give one move such as bazooka or tornado death spin for each boss   the game is easy to beat but offers extras for breaking all the boxes or beating a level quickly   it 's extremely difficult to collect all of them   i recommend this game for everyone especially people with a lot of free time on their hands
this game is just as much fun as the first one with whole new levels based on the now classic crash bandicoot gameplay i would recommend this to anyone crash fan or not
i have played this game before and it is very fun that is why i came to amazon to order myself another copy of the game so that i could go back in time and enjoy a classic game however i bought it from the seller 34;warehouse deals inc&#34 and i did not get my game and there is no place for me to get in contact with them watch out
golden eye 007 is still one of the best action titles ever created along with the best licensed product ever released the action is still superb and well polished even since its release 10 years ago the enemies are still smart even with competitors like f.e.a.r. which have incredibly intelligent artificial intellignce there are a couple of issues unfortunately some targeting problems and odd save layouts other than those this game is still one of the best shooters ever made the missions are excellent the enemies are cool the weapons are cool and virtually everything else about this game is superb and well executed too bad nintendo handed the rights of james bond to ea
first the single player is awesome then the multiplayer battle gets even better but then when you add game shark it becomes the best game ever one problem is that it is a bit unrealistic because there are up to 400 shots in a clip magazine otherwise the game is good also if you like this game you will want perfect dark if you like this game but wish it was more realistic get rainbow six
i came upon this game in the late 90s early 00s me and a couple of friends would play it religiously and i must say that although the characters are better and more original in this game perfect dark if you have n't had a chance to play that is the superior shooter they both are fun in their own right though they were both made by rare which did wonders for the n64 gracing us with the aforementioned games and also diddy kong racing which i played for hours on end with friends also fun levels to play in and the music was pretty damn good too like i said i liked the characters natalia being my absolute favorite and i kept coming back to this game even the single player mode was fun just not nearly as fun as the multi player mode fun single player c+ multi player b+sound b characters b+controls a overall b
with this game you play through each level in the movie   this is when james bond was james bond   you can choose from a whole list of players to choose from to play as   you can get any kind of weapon just about through the whole game   and you can even play with some friends on missions   if you have never played a n64 what are you waiting for   5 out of 5   super fun
i have to be honest normally i 'm not into these first person shooter games   they 're just so clunky most of the time you ca n't tell where you 're going you do n't know if an enemy is behind you or at times even in front of you if you get a weird camera angle and plus might i add that you ca n't see your character which does not really for me most of the time give that whole imaginative feel that you are that character well goldeneye is an excellent and well made game i do n't know why people complain about the graphics ... it 's actually kind of cool and plus the enemies in this game are from head to toes so detailed that you think they 're real   the scientists in the facility level are well detailed and most all the characters are animated incredibly besides you take on the role of james bond   james bond the hero that defined action this game is not dull and at times it is so scary when you are overswarmed by a bunch of enemies in one small room the multiplayer mode is of course wonderful   you can choose from power weapons sniper rifels dostovals shotguns pp7 's proximity mines hand grenades laser guns and basicly everything else that you can think of   it is an entertaining game and it is well worth the money the camera angles rock   you never get lost so why did n't i give this game five stars   read below and find out the bads of the gamethere are some major glitches   you can see your enemies literally walk through walls not completely but almost there at times the doors when i command it to open with the b button it still wo n't open even if i already did get an access card for the door in the first place   the reason behind that is the fact that an enemy is probably trying to open the door as well but how am i supposed to know that so i stand back the enemy comes in and oh guess what it turns out that there is n't just one of them there 's thirty so they all shoot at me and i die   you can easily die in this game just due to glitches which makes it very difficult and frustrating if you forget one thing on a mission just one small thing which most of the time has nothing to do with the story then you have to start the whole mission over again   you do n't just do the thing you forgot either you have to do all the things that you did do as well as the things you did not the game is predictible due to the fact that it follows the movie although when it does not follow the movie which it does a lot then it gets kind of dissapointing because what you expected did not happen the puzzles can be frustrating   i 'm still trying to figure out how to get the bottling room on the facility level the game is also very gory   i do n't know why they gave this game a teen rating instead of a mature ... it should of been rated mature now for the goods of this game goodsuse an incredibly large arsenal of weaponry and more weaponry ... prepare to save the world it 's gon na be a rough ride it follows the movie really well most of the time anyways and if you 're a big fan of james bond you will really enjoy this game   even if you are n't you 'll still enjoy it you play the role of james bond which is worth it within itself this game is the greatest first person shooter game for the n64   the controls are n't so difficult that you 'll get lost and forget which buttons to use while you 're losing but they are simple and easy and at the same time fun   and even if you do n't like the controls you can decide which buttons you want for which ones the controller screen there 's nothing that you ca n't shoot or destroy the cheats are funny   i mean honestly try the invisibility mode you can shoot a near bye dashboard when a gaurd is near and that gaurd will start freaking out and look around to see who did that   this makes the game easier also and the invincibility mode is good too although i tried and realized that you ca n't have the invisibility mode and invincibility at the same time   you can also make the bad guys heads small and stuff which is really funny to see the way that the characters are animated are almost identicle to the characters in the movie ... they look exactly like the actors at the end of every level it tells you how many kills you did how many limb shots how many head shots and how many body shots you had the artificial intelligence with the badguys are n't all that challenging but when there 's a whole crowd of them watch out!this game is excellent   did i mention that it 's excellent let me repeat it again this game is excellent excellent i tell you excellent
this is game was based on the movie and they hit it spot on playing the levels are fun but this is the perfect game to play if you are just sitting around with a few friends talkin about the old times
with the nintendo 64 beginning to slowly ... okay quickly drop off the gaming radar it 's time for gamers who bought the last of the big n 's cartridge systems to see if their investment was a good one is there even a reason to keep this system around anymore is there one game to give you an excuse to say to playstation2 and x box and gamecube owners i know it 's an old system but this game is the reason i still own it yes and that game is called golden eye 007" it 's hard to believe that a game based off the best of the pierce brosnan bond movies would become an undeniable classic but that 's exactly what golden eye is many first person shooters try to overwhelm gamers with unbelievable graphics while offering no depth in gameplay while others try to create complex game engines with passable graphics and end up only frustrating players thankfully golden eye is the diamond in the rough it takes a remarkably simple control scheme and graphics that were good for its time and combines them in an unbeatable combination moving bond james bond is as easy as breathing and the shooting system is just as simple even with the horrible n64 controller a player can learn how to play golden eye on the first or second try and its gameplay is so addictive because of the stunning level designs and adequate ai of course because of the n64 's difficult to program cartridge format some things had to be sacrificed like detailed textures and realistic ai responses to being shot but the overall experience is enough to overlook such trivial matters graphically golden eye 007 was a marvel to look at ... when it was first released nowadays when compared to games like metal gear solid 2 for the ps2 and dead or alive 3 for the x box golden eye looks like a snes game because cartridges are limited in space textures can be bland character models look blocky and detail is kept to a passable minimum but anyone who does n't care about graphics as long as they are good enough and the gameplay is excellent should n't have any trouble with golden eye" soundwise it 's not the biggest strength of the game but it 's still good sounds like gunshots are remarkably well done a player can tell what kind of gun he or an enemy is firing just by listening to it at least to a certain extent and voices while limited to overdone grunts and questionable laughs suit the game well it would 've been nice to hear full voiceovers for important characters but the limitations of the cartridge format does n't help this area much all in all golden eye is undoubtedly a classic of modern gaming while the n64 is arguably one of the worst nintendo consoles to be released alongside the horrendous virtua boy it still had some incredible games that managed to sustain it until the gamecube was announced golden eye is not only the game that many fps fans point to as their favorite game but many non fps gamers also found it very enjoyable while later great first person shooters like the n64 's perfect dark and the recent x box million seller halo presented excellet fps action with updated graphics to boot golden eye will forever be remembered as the first person shoot for the masses if you need a reason to keep your n64 this is it
goldeneye 007 is the best game for the nintendo 64 its an amazing game and its still fun to play today there was a game called perfect dark that was similar to this and came out later but this is the far better game tons of great guns and gadgets are here and the gameplay is awesome its not the best first person shooter ever(halo for xbox is but its still one of the best the graphics are nt the best ever right now but at the time in 1997 or so they were real great the music is good it has a mysterious sound to it for some reason this game has some of the best levels in any game and it controls great multiplayer in this game is some of the most addictive ever at the time it had the best multiplayer around it might not now since there are games like halo and diablo ii but like i said it was the best at the time there are nt really any negatives all hail to the best game on n64 and one of the best games ever
goldeneye 007 at first glance looks like yet another installment into the tired and outdated first person shooter game genre the big suprise is that it is so much more than a standard shooter or a bog standard movie translation in a word goldeneye is amazing it takes full advantage of the 64 bit technology and delivers a smooth fun and challenging adventure you assume the role of james bond the secret agent who needs no introduction you run through various missions which tie into the movie and solve various problems and perform various tasks what complicates things is the number of guards who are ready to kill you on sight as expected you have a number of weapons at your disposal from the silenced pistol and machine gun to the grenade launchers and high powered explosives the first person perspective adds amazing realism to this game with action and controls that are as smooth as james bond 's charm the graphics are phenominal with smooth movements and amazing scenery this game really makes you feel like you are living the adventures the music is right out of a bond movie and adds a nice edge to the action the controls usually quite clunky on that horrible n64 controller are easy to manage here after a while it becomes like second nature for parents considering this game for their children they should be aware of the violence much of the game is spent killing people and the realism is striking it is up to you but this is an excellent game that can be quite addictive
this game has plenty of levels weapons and it has challenging gameplay with a pretty good multi player but i wish u could face computers in the multi player good graphics great play control and sound get this game if u do n't already have perfect dark
the game is overrated do n't get sucked into all the hype it 's more nostalgic for the people who played it when it first came out the graphics are honestly really bad and the controls make you feel like you 're drunk i guess that 's where the fun is though because honestly i really did like the game i played through it and although the gameplay schematics were a bit ... strange it was oddly addicting multiplayer is a lot of fun though when you have friends sitting down in the basement all hooked up it can get pretty intense on split screen seriously 5 stars for the split screen 4 stars overall because the gameplay was repetitive and the graphics were vomit they could have been better for the time period and the n64 was capable of handling better than this still worth the buy get it
in the year 1997 goldeneye was released for the nintendo 64 by rare an unknown company and new 2nd party developer rare had already made several games for the nes and enters the nintendo 64 market with this release based on the classic james bond movie of the same title you can ask anyone who had a nintendo 64 if they ever played this game and why it was so popular you 're guaranteed to hear 2 reasons in particular why this game is so revered reason 1 this game is a prime example of how a developer took its time to make this game it was more than 2 years since the movie it was based on came out and rare had access to everything concerning the movie from the original orchestral music likeness of the main characters and locations to the bonus villains of other james bond movies such as oddjob and mayday they did n't rush this out the door like some developers do when they wanted their games released alongside the films it was based on and it always guaranteed to be a huge mistake this game was a huge success and is still played by many video gamers reason 2 nintendo had no idea that the multi player section of this game would be just as popular to play in or more popular than the single player mode rare admitted in an interview after the game was released that they had no intentions of putting together a multi player mode until later in its development stages though it may be limited by today 's standards you had the basics several stages based on the single player mode all of the weapons were available all of the main characters plus the enemy soldiers and classic bond villains and several game modes such as free for all death match team death match you only live twice 2 lives etc and you can select the weapons in group categories along with time limits per match this added a lot of re playability after you finished the single player mode if you do n't have a nintendo 64 this game is reason enough to get it this game helped nintendo sell so many systems and it is a title i highly recommend getting if you can find it it 's a great game to play by yourself and an absolute blast to play with 3 of your friends peace :)
this game offers it all   shooting action adrenaline pumping duck and dodge fire fights rescue missions covert action gadgets evil villains story and plot and a lot of weapons   i reccomend this to any gaming fan   buy this game right now   you do n't know what you 're missing if you do n't   the game also offers an incredible ammount of replay value with dozens of cheats that can be activated by getting record times in levels and also two levels that can be activated by beatin gthe game on different levels of difficulty   all in all a completely amazing game   buy it   do n't hesitate
even for a gamecube and ps2 owner for me this is the game that started it all and while old goldeneye is still exhilerating i was stupid enough to trade in my goldeneye copy for a nwer but not better game do n't make the same mistake that i did please it is hard to get your hands on a good copy of goldeneye these days protect your goldeneye games this game lives up perfectly to the movie and for a 1997 game the graphics and sound are excellent sure nightfire 's fun but it never revolutionized the gaming world like goldeneye did goldeneye shoots twine and agent under fire out of the sky nightfire ca n't even hold its ground against this solid and superb n64 title in goldeneye you will encounter all of the characters and locations from the goldeneye film and the single player campaign holds its ground but multiplayer is where the game really shines and it is so much better than timesplitters or timesplitters 2 even i have not played goldeneye for over a year but the music rings in my head and i have the levels memorized perfectly even if you worship your perfect dark copy i believe that goldeneye is better and i have a strong debate on that the bottom line is that goldeneye is the best fps ever created it boils down to this if you own an n64 please play your goldeneye copy or if you do n't even know what this wonderful game is about buy it now hey all x box owners goldeneye is even better than halo there 's no debate on that buy the game that started it all!my rating:9.9

i have fond memories of this game and still get together to play it with friends before goldeneye first person shooters were primarily pc affairs played with a keyboard and mouse and multiplayer required either internet or network capabilities which at the time i did n't have goldeneye changed this just like mario kart you could get four players hooked in except instead of bumping bowser off a race track you were running around and laying down the heat as bond or one of his allies antagonists there are plenty of modes arenas and weapons to choose from ranging from deathmatch to flag tag and once in a while you have to play with slappers only "in addition to the multiplayer aspects it has an excellent single player mode it 's mission objective based meaning that failure is entirely possible and as difficulty increases so do the number of objectives and conditions you have to fulfill the music is also notable sure it 's entirely synhtesized midi but in those days that was the state of the art the music fits the scenes pretty well mostly being varied riffs on the classic john barry bond theme some being a little different the game contains a nice variety of weapons and plenty of secrets to unlock by speedrunning levels while fulfilling all objectives).whether you 've never played this classic or you 're looking back on the good old days you should play it thisis rare 's n64 masterwork perfect dark is pretty sweet too
i like this game but its not really fun its kinda boring its really confusing the game when you die you have too start over but i do nt think you can press save 5/10
alright this will most likely be the only time i will ever give a n64 game 5 stars but for goldeneye i eill make an exception ok goldeneye was 64 's jump into the world of high tech video game systems but unfortunately they could n't keep it up this was a very solid 1st person shooter excellent graphics and not even repetitive secenary what more could you ask for in a game the weapons were great maybe a little exaggerated at times but over all good long levels and lots of them made this game excel in the lasting appeal category sound was good but not having the cd quality sound os a ps or a dc hirt it a little unfortunately goldeneye got a little smack in the face when everybody started comparing it to the flopped perfect dark game but overall a great game and even though i am a die hard playstation fan i still have a place in my heart for goldeneye
when i purchased this game the graphics were obviously amazing with the new nintendo 64 i used to play this hours on end doing the single player missions over and over and also having some friends over to play multiplayer after the playstation 2 came out i pushed the nintendo 64 over for a few weeks but i found my self slowly returning to some goldeneye along with a few other great nintendo 64 games now that i have a 360 i rarely play goldeneye anymore but with the recent purchase of a n64 i have again found myself playing goldeneye with all the wonderful fun cheats that it offers this game changed the way we play games totally it is still one of the best games i own right next to the newest xbox 360 games
this is a cool game   you complete every mission on 00 agent and you unlock the 007 difficulty level   you do n't need a memory pak or card to play this game
i played this game when i was about 15 and i 'm now 24 and still love it to the death literally i have a blast shooting other things other than just people and watching bullet holes go into the items and how it looks so freaking real i also have always loved how you can choose many different people in 2 player mode such as 007 to scientist the golden gun is the coolest because it only takes on shot to kill but if you like a really smashing good time you can always punch or cut your way out a must have game for the 64 :-)
this ganme was very entertaining i really enjoyed it i 'm not to fond of these types of games but goldeneye was awesome
i love this game it is so funny and a bit hard to beat the hardest level is in the temple where a shuttle is launching and you have to collect data kill jaws get launch tape and launch the shuttle my favorite level is the facility level that level is so funny and you can shoot the scientists but it will fail the mission if they were killed my cousin and i love to blow up the enemies and scientists my favorite is shooting the scientists and enemies in their butts and they would jump up and down rubbing their butts and then they will fight back and the scientists will threw grenades at you the controls are easy and this game is better and funnier than the movie buy this game
awesome controls greta levels killer music loads of cool guns and awesome james bond   the perfect shooter   played this one a lot
i still get this game out everything is ideal if they ca n't recreate this it will be a shame n64 ruled in the old days this and mario were so amazingly fun it was constant you could play for months on end and still love it to death while finding something entirely new and exciting
this game is a keeper to have and i would n't mind playing another james bond game which i 'm getting from russia with love and that means there will be more fights to the end i just keep playing this game over again
though wolfenstein 3-d and the doom franchise had come and gone long before its time goldeneye for the nintendo 64 grabbed the first person shooter genre and ran with it for what seemed like miles and miles forget a touchdown this game ran the ball for fifteen hundred yards with three interceptions and a dozen field goals nothing on a home console was even close to its league and even today in the afterglow of behemoths like halo metroid prime and a limitless roster of pc shooters the game holds up surprisingly well considering its limitations it 's difficult to call any game perfect no matter how original how exciting how breathtaking it may look sound play or feel there remain a couple frustratingly overlooked areas and goldeneye is no exception most notably poor are the one or two levels which feature a limitless stockpile of enemy soldiers no lie i 've memorized the layout of a base from start to finish known there 's nowhere these soldiers could be coming from and watched as dozens and dozens miraculously appear from thin air to resume their fallen brothers attack it makes strategy an impossibility and frustrates the player to their wits end in addition there 's the small matter of dead or dying enemy soldiers who stand in the way every once in a while an armed adversary will take a head shot and then stand blankly staring for several moments before slowly dropping to the floor this would n't be such a bad thing if the other soldiers bullets could n't pass right through him so you 'll often find yourself firing into the chest of a dead man a futile attempt to get at the soldiers behind him all the while taking fire from those still breathing on the other side of his body despite my small misgivings however 99 of this game plays flawlessly the progression of difficulty is astounding moving from the relatively easy early levels to a series of seemingly impassible stages near the cart 's conclusion and it 's all done while walking that razor 's edge between being excessively cheap and being overly giving the player realises these missions are possible even as he 's watching bond die for the twelfth time in as many minutes add to all that three difficulty levels cheats that must be unlocked with speed precision and overall know how hidden stages and hidden characters not only do you have a legendary fps you 've also found nearly limitless replay value goldeneye is more than just a very good game it 's the stuff legends are made of it 's a game you 'll want to play with your grandkids years from now hands down the most attractive part about bond 's n64 debut even today is its controls the nintendo 64 controller was seemingly created exclusively for use with 007 's repertoire as every button is in precisely the right place for its function it truly is the kind of thing that takes five minutes to learn and a lifetime to master the center grip of the n64 controller seems to become the handle of a silenced pp7 bond 's revolver of choice the z button is a perfect trigger and if you 've purchased a rumble pack you can even feel the weapon kick back when you fire strafing is done effortlessly with the right hand as is crouching and adjusting the zoom of a sniper rifle no control system has ever felt so immersive so right after the first level you hardly recognize the controller is there it 's already become such an extension of your own body i ca n't sing any higher a praise than that if you 've seen the feature film of the same name you 'll notice some eerie similarities everything from the writing on a wall in the city to the placement of the soldiers deep within a russian bunker is precisely as it was seen on the silver screen it 's honestly unsettling how well the level designers did their jobs ever wondered what was behind that last bathroom stall in the film you 'll get your chance to find the answer on the n64 it 's an experience i ca n't really put into words something i 'd never seen before and have n't seen since it 's a level of perfectionism that has yet to be matched in a video game adaption finally there 's the multiplayer aspect of 007 while the single player mode is challenging unique and groundbreaking multiplayer is absolutely unreal i had the good fortune of living in a large college dorm complex at the time this game was first released and thus experienced more multiplayer bond than i 'd wish on anyone there were literally lines leading into my room just for the chance to grab one of our four controllers and get into the action it was an addictive community event whenever that little red light on the front of our n64 lit up truly something special with multiple modes of play a handful of playable levels some hidden surprises and dozens of options you were guaranteed to never play the same match twice and it did n't take much for the lighthearted action to become a cold hearted war in a time and place where four player deathmatches are a no brainer it 's hard to imagine a game that pioneered the field goldeneye blazed that path and did so in style it cleared out the weeds flattened the hills and paved the roads that halo drives its way across today truly the game was revolutionary and it still plays as such in short goldeneye is almost reason alone to own a nintendo 64 even today there 's a charm about it that ca n't be described a realism and authenticity that goes beyond the aging graphics and occasionally slow gameplay it 's got the look and feel of a legend and that 's exactly the word i 'd use to describe it while there are certainly flaws this is a game you 'll kick yourself for never owning in a few years when it becomes increasingly difficult to track down
goldeneye became the steeple for how the bond series was going to be and i 'm glad that it was because for me i could never get tired of this game because of it 's awesome challenges graphics gameplay and of course the gore factor very bloody game maybe a no for younger gamers but for those of us older gamers a definite).level after level this game played almost to a t like the movie and you got to use all of bond 's weapons from his magnum to a bazooka to grenades and plastic explosives and of course the one hit kill golden gun this also had the perfect multi player vs mode in the history of the 64 system where else could you blow up 3 of your friends with a bazooka at the same time if you were lucky enough to stumble upon them shooting it out with each other).goldeneye has never left my 64 rotation and again i still love to play the multi player when my friends come over i will again stress to those of us who are parents like myself that you should maybe think otherwise if you have some young gamers because it is very violent and very bloody for those of you without that restriction go wild and get this game you wo n't be disappointed
goldeneye 007 was simply the greatest game ever made no if ands or buts this game stood out from the rest giving itself the title of the almighty master of the game world my uncle steve was the first person to tell me about the game in 1997 and told me i had to get goldeneye and told me its the best game he ever played and he only had a playstaion at the time i played this game when it first game out i was 11 years old and i 'm now 24 and still love it to the death goldeneye set the standards for every fps that has followed
ever since i purshased goldeneye 007 on the old n64 i became highly addicted to it like many other gamers around the world i also have to thank this game as well because it made me a hardcore james bond fan this is the best first person shooting game ever although dated the detail of this game is amazing there 's over 14 levels of shooting my favorite missions are the first level the silo mission the train mission and the very last level highly recommended game it fuels the senses if you like james bond or any type of video game get it mostly all of you have
i got this game when it first came out which was a couple years ago but i 'm just now writing the review strange is n't it   this game is what makes having an n64 so great   the graphics are just sweet   the story pretty much follows the movie and alters a little things to make it more enjoyable for us gamers   this game is very easy to control   that 's one of the best things about it the controls are placed if logical places and it 's better than the turok controls   the best part of this game is the multiplayer   it 's what made the game so famous   killing your friends has never been this much fun   i 'll never get tired of one of my friends walking in a hallway unsuspecting that a proximity mine is waiting there to take his digital life   the best multiplayer level has got to be the facility   but i 'll let you the buyer decide for yourself   another game i recommend and that 's probebly better is perfect dark
i am a major player of 007 games i have played nearly every single one but i have to say goldeneye is one of the best that there is even years and platforms later even though i have a gamecube with all of the other 007 games i still to this day find myself returning to play a round of goldeneye goldeneye has a great plotline in my opinion even better than the movie and long missions which allow a lot of replay value the graphics are a bit blurry but that is to be expected in an n64 fps.overall i love this game and would reccomend it to any 007 fan
one of the games that made n64 so great had graphics for the time multiplayer all around fun and in my opinion one of the best games of it 's time
goldeneye 007 is one of the best game 's for the nintendo 64 when you hear pepole say the game is great there not kiddin   i 've had this game for a while and i 'm still coming back to it it 's an 11/10 replay value i 'd give goldeneye 007 more star 's if i could if you want a game that you can come back to year 's later and a great game for alot of pepole then get goldeneye 007
another rareware classic   the game that defines 1st person shooter like the title says rare did it best   i love the pc shooters like doom quake duke nukem   but 007 did it 1000   the first of it 's kind ... perfect 3-d graphics 360 control   and the first game to do stealth right   you can sneak through levels stealth with your silenced pistol or go all out nuts with the ak   this model of game would go on to influence all future fps   ps3 xbox fanboys take notice   if rare had n't come up with this formula modern warfare halo would n't exist as they are
goldeneye has to be one of the best multiplayer games ever   i still play this game against friends even though i have a ps2 now   the graphics are still ok to look at even though i have seen far better on dc and ps2 it has excellant replay value and is very challenging to defeat on all difficulty settings   pick this up if you want the best fps on n64
... for it 's timegoing back and replaying this game is weird and fun it 's fun to see how bad the graphics were and how you did n't see it that way back in the day.considering how easy it is to buy old games this is a must buy
there were a few stickers on the cartridge but it 's alright because the game worked fine and it 's such a fun game when you 're on multiplayer mode
this game is boring get the one for gamecube if you can that is much more fun
i remember playing multiplayer tournaments on this when i was younger and still play against my son when i can

golden eye on the nintendo 64 needs no introduction it redefined the fps genere it had great controlls for it 's day stuck as close as it could with the movie it was a major killer app for the 64 around   97 98 the music was good the graphics were decent enough there dated now but this game was still is the t golden eye never has failed on any level i still play it from time to time the multiplayer back in the summer of 98 me my friends or my brother or his friends or my cousin we all played the multiplayer to death should you get this game well it 's been out since the late 90 's if you never played it your missing out it warrants a purchase of a n 64 for this game alone golden eye for the 64 is as good if not better than movie
i thought that i 'd review some james bond 007 video games the games that i own you know it 's going to be the 50th anniversary this year which i might see skyfall but i 'm here to review the best 007 game by far golden eye on the nintendo 64 which was a game that was only exclusive to the n64 meaning back in 97 it was like hey you need to go out buy a nintendo 64 i remember playing this game a lot in 1998 it 's an amazing game all around of course the multiplayer is what stands out i played it a lot with my brother my friends cousin a lot the single player mode is well done the game play is great the weapon selection is the best of all the 007 games for what it is it does a good job of following the movie golden eye going through the 1st 3 levels it deals with the beginning of the movie where you think 006 alec treyvelyn was kill where bond escapes in the plane there is a level you saw in the movie servenya that you go to you have to go there twice the 2nd time is where you meet natalya who in the movie you meet in the helicopter explosion of course you meet janus at the statue park who turns out to be treyvelyn you get to use a tank just like in the movie you get to go through the train depot which is n't in the movie the train level is pretty good there are lines that alec treyvelyn says in the movie on this level the last 4 levels is pretty much the movie towards the end this game is 1 of the best 1st person shooters out there it changed the genre if you never played golden eye on the n64 i ca n't reccommend it enough i 'm not talking about the new 1 which i have yet to play
no doubt the best nentendo game ever created up till this day   this game is better than all the nentendo games for all it 's systems   it has the best multi player game ever for any system and a a- single player game   the only thing about the multiplayer game is that it could use a bit more weapons   and the single player game is up there with metal gear solid the original   it 's game has lots of levels and is very challenging but in a good way   it 's cheat options are really hard to get but once you do it makes the game even more awsome   so overall you only need one word to describe this game spectacular
the level 's are great and there is a lot to do to save the world in the nick of time before some bad happen 's you as bond as you go into the game they are other bad guy 's are trying to kill you as you try to save the world hey buy this game you will have a time of you life and trying to stay alive hey it true it is a good game to play by yourself or two people hey go buy the game and find out what i'am talking about ok i play it over ten time because it great to get into by the away they are four bad guy 's are after you so run run run for your life well just in the game are you lucky do n't spoil yourself over this game i have keep your cool in the game so good lucky ps your going to need it there are easy levels and hard levels and there are very hard level 's get ready for a big adventure to save the world there are characters in the game just like the movie is that cool or what
... br this game more than any other for the nintendo 64 is what will come to mind when most ppl think of the n64   mainly because this was one of the first shooter games to require the gamer to use his brain to solve puzzles and get thru the nasty surprises the game will throw at you   not following the bloodlust of previous first shooter games like doom heretic turok etc this game is in a class of its own   it gives you objectives to complete however unlike perfect dark it adds to the challenge by giving you deadly surprises that are not mentioned in the mission breifing these will make at least restart a few levels over and over until you figure it out for yourself   its a much better game than any other first shooter i ve played since it stresses stealthy behavior and intelligence on the part of the player to succeed granted it does not have the extras in the multiplayer section that perfect dark has but it has an element of challenge that perfect dark will never have
even though this game was released over ten years ago i still have fond memories of it this game really pushed the capabilities of the nintendo 64 with its 3d if somewhat still pixelated surroundings there were enough options and variety to make the game interesting you could go through the levels in easy normal and hard mode and beating the levels in certain difficulty levels within certain time limits would unlock cheats some of the cheats were silly like donkey kong mode but others were cooler like invisible or infinite ammo mode playing the levels in easy mode was a great way to prep/'study for normal and hard modes exploring the surroundings knowing where to go so you could complete the extra requirements that came with the difficult mode the save mode allowed one to explore the levels at their leisure sometimes i played a level i already beat just for fun and exploration ignoring the time molti player mode was also a lot of fun the graphics in this game were not as refined as the wii and ps3 because nintendo 64 was a groundbreaking console when it came out and the 3d graphics ability was not quite fully mastered yet so for those of you used to the smoother graphics of today 's current consoles you might notice a bit of clunkiness and the characters had blocky hands and limbs and their faces looked painted on their heads but the 3d was well done in terms of set up and surroundings as far as movement and exploration of the world went so two thumbs up even now i prefer this game to many newer ones because the plotline and play was very good a- for a wonderful overall game
this is one of my favorite fps 's of all time it stands right alongside halo and battlefield 1942 the single player missions are done wonderfully the enviroments are great and the multiplayer is the best i have ever played buy this
this is the one game that i would play day in and day out for more than a year   the one game where i discovered something new almost every time i played   it was the one game which brought me and my friends together religiously at least 3 or 4 times a week   somehow it just would n't die no matter how hard we tried at first it just seemed so standard and bland   playing muliplayer for the first time i had problems finding guns and felt confused and bored running through the temple level   soon somehow something clicked and me and my friends   ended up playing it for about 4 hours straight   towards the end of that introductory marathon goldeneye session we took our first stride out of the standard deathmatch restriction- increasing my character 's health to its highest limit and my friends fighting against me   thus we coined the quot;god&quot mode and we played this variant to death in the coming months it did n't end there   we had fests where we would do nothing but attack each other with punches   we bought a bunch of video cable and conected three televisions together to form a sort of splitscreen lan type mode covering up other player 's screens so we would n't know where the other players were   we playedthe team mode constantly refining our knowledge of the levels and our marksmanship   fed up with auto aiming we turned it off and further honed our skills   i began to be able to play the complex level in my sleep   proximity mines soon became an addiction   we pushed the game to its limits learning that we could move the ammo boxes shields and guns around by shooting them thus reworking their positions and creating large stockpiles in team games   we began to use gameshark to unlock multiplayer maps that were n't intended for the final version as well as increasing the limits on two and three player maps to four players   we discovered a code that turned one player invisible and proceeded to do hunter hunted scenarios over splitscreen basically it was the first game to really show limitless possibilities   it was a revolution for first person shooters and so many have overlooked this fact   it was the first to have targeting of individual body parts over 20 weapons to choose from realistic glass shooting out of lights and bullet holes and for its time fairly revolutionary ai   all in all it was an experience that defined video games for me and few if any have matched it with a similar addictive experience
this is the best shoot em up on the n64 i was very impressed with the game play the graphics the action the multi player fun everything .... the only downfall about the game is i wanted more more more the cheats are great when you unlock them and the best thing is you do nt need a memory card everything saves on the cartridge rare actualy managed to compress a game that was too big for the n64 into this game somehow and it suprises me that it does not even use the n64 expansion pack to do that this game is not just hoursand hours of fun but days weeks years i still play this cool game even today
goldeneye 007 on the now obsolete ninetndo 64 is still to this day my favourite game of all time before the nintendo 64 arrived i was a massive sega fan nothing anyone said could put me off my sega obsession and then i played mario 64 and everything changed i went out and swapped my sega saturn and all it 's games for a brand new nintendo 64 and a second hand copy of mario 64 and i never looked back then allmost a year later goldeneye 007 arrived and introduced me to a whole new genre you see before goldeneye i had never played a first person shooter so it was all new to me i also happened to be a huge james bond fan at the time so i was quite excited about playing this for the first time and i was not dissapointed everything about this game just worked so well it had the right feel a bond game should have it was also one of the most addictive multi player games ever me and me mates would spend hours playing this game the weapons are some of the best ever in a first person shotter the snipper riffle in particular was awsome to use and the tank levels were so much fun since goldeneye there been some trully amazing shooters including the brilliant half life but for some reason i have yet to play a game that has that same magic as rare 's wonderful game if you have n't played this yet then you do n't know what you 're missing
very good fps game although multiplayer mode does lag highly recommend for your n64 collection this one is a classic
lord it has been too darn long since i last played this master piece the single player mode is too much fun but the 99 of the credit goes to the multi game mode great selection of weapons nice variety of levels huge list of characters to choose from from the original bond movies fun options while playing bobble head characters paint ball shooting marks).i am telling you the game was the center of attention with friends large gatherings challenges playing till the break of dawn i will give the game credit from keeping us off the streets =) .i do n't know if i can find this game but boy if you can find three friends and play it without mercy all the best nawaf
golden eye games that are coming out now owe their controls to golden eye based on the movie the game is truly hard hiting gameplay action that is super fun this game is a very great shooting game one of the best shooting game of all time golden eye has a great story and goes along with the new 007 games that are coming out redifine the origin by playing this game if you have n't sure the graphics are n't that great but dude its nitendo 64 they should remake this game and other classic 64 games for nitendo gamecube if you still play 64 god have mercy you will also love perfect dark if your buying this game for some reason you should add perfect dark same game play action but for some reason i love quot;perfect dark&quot better but that s me .....
i loved this game and playing it now after all these years it 's still awesome   multiplayer on a split screen is still fun
the multiplayer is amazing but most reviews already cover that i still have yet to beat the last level cradle and the 2 bonus missions on the hardest difficulty after 12 years and yet i am addicted to trying over and over i finished the campaign twice on the 1st 2 difficulties each difficulty higher the more parts of the level you explore and the more crazy scenarios you will experience places and scenarios that you did not experience in the easier difficulties .. many missions you can go about using stealth or guns blazing it is always fun trying to beat facility or bunker 1 with just a silenced pp7 without alerting anyone nothing is more satisfying than shooting 2 gaurds to death with a silenced ppk before they can hit the alarm in some levels if you are feeling arrogant you can hit the alarm yourself and take on hundreds of enemies and go rambo there is so much about this game i could go on for days about how amazing this game is no modern aaa fps has surpassed goldeneye on n64 campaign to this day the remakes have been complete crap despite the amazing cod engine if you own a n64 and love perfect dark or other great fps adventures you will love this
yeah this is one of the classics that blew away everyone n64 magazines got better because of it and bonded friends and family for years on end there was no other game like it empire magazine started writing better games reviews because of it this was a mental good multiplayer in 1997 we all played this side by side for years i ca n't say i have played anything quite like it since golden eye n64 yeah those where the days i remember this left playstation 1 owners in awe
i purchased this game after a nostalgia case i had lol and it worked just fine i would buy another if this one failed
this game is ok but mostly mediocre this is the best that the n64 had to offer alongside the wrestling games and resident evil 2 just goes to show that the nintendrone cult are way off the mark the sony playstation 1 had better games and far better immersion due to having the cd storage   this game like i said is ok but hardly as good as the nintendrones have made it out to be the production of the game is basically weak with the menu intro being pathetic and the music repeating over and over and over on each board the gameplay is ok in that i can mow down enemies while running but the aiming sucks and it gets boring having to mow down enemies that keep spawning over and over while i figure out how to complete the mission finally the multiplayer is wayyyyyy overrated i remember playing it with 4 other players all day for   a couple days and never feeling into it the quad split screen was a big nuisance   thank goodness for online play today the games today completely own goldeneye in every category especially the funfactor so yeah there you go nintendrones the playstation brand rightfully won that gen and your crowning achievement in console gaming has turned out to be a dated and weak title oh yeah rare is now exposed as being mediocre your cult like devotion to nintendo made them rich at least they have n't made anything decent since though
my n64 it acts like a rock sitting right there under my tv i bought a total of 8 count em 8 games on this pathetic system i have what about 60 for my computer but this game made me believe that a good shooter could be made on consoles although very few of the ports from pc to consoles are usually the original games for the consoles are good.)of those 8 games i have this one is worth about 10 the makers of this game are geniuses and have spread that on to other games like the timesplitters series if there is any game that will make me buy a gamecube besides metroid prime it is timesplitters 2 it is a master peace that will be lived on in my memories and it will remain stuck in my damn cartrage slot of my forgotten n64 or it would be forgotten if not for this game
this game was okay it could 've been better   i like the story it 's way different than it is in the movie it 's more fun   but like i said before perfect dark 64 is the new bond   the main story is fun and so is the multiplayer combat   there 's a crap load of bond characters to unlock and levels too   but i 'm not a bond fan in fact i hate bond   but this game is fun
the movie goldeneye was a box office hit and now it comes to nintendo every wonder how james bond found natalia how xenia died or how bond killed trevalyn now you get to do it yourself you travel to siberia to recover blueprints go on a battleship to save hostages launch a space shuttle and shoot all the bad guys you want with over 30 weapons from gernades lasers all handguns machine guns and rocket and nuclear bombs try out the game to see what you would do if you were bond here 's your chance to be 007
the names bond james bond those five words mark the saying of probably on of the most famous fictional spy of all time and finally he came to the nintendo 64 this game is by far the best game for any console it kicks resident evil 's butt all the way back to campcom 's facility to teach them not to make such stupid looking games
great game but perfect dark is way better if you really like bond or you can find this game cheap somewhere you might want to pick it up but if you 're just looking for a good first person shooter or multiplayer game skip it and get perfect dark instead
goldeneye set the standards for every fps that has followed it is the best of the best the levels are action packed and extremely memorable i can do the levels in my head i 've played them so many times the graphics are dull now but back in the day these visuals were top notch the music involves some of the best techno i 've ever heard the game is also surprisingly difficult i took me ten years to beat all the difficulty levels the multiplayer is ahead of it 's time with four player large arena style deathmatches this game should be missed by no one pick up a copy today and first hand see the best presentation- this game captures what it is to be james bond there are a great deal of weapons cool menus and music that still rocks to this day all around a great feeling game the blood rolling down the screen after you die is epic 5/5story- the game follows the story of goldeneye pretty closely and there are two bonus levels that follow other bond movies including one of the hardest levels of all time the aztec based on the movie moonraker 5/5graphics- this game looked amazing for it 's day now it may be unimpressing but remember what the world of n64 looked liked 5/5 game play- this is the part that could be helped by a remake the n64 controller only has one joystick this is awkward sometimes but the use of the c pad to strafe helps nintendo please remake this amazing gem 4.5/5sound- some of the best music in a video game ever made catchy music that i even have on my ipod to this day 5/5lasting appeal- i still play this game regularly when the current generation games anger me i can play levels in my head need i say more this game will never be forgotten or equaled 5/5rating 4.9/5
this game was awesome when i was little and owned my original n64 and it 's still awesome to this day you just ca n't outdo a good thing and this game proves it
i had to use a gameshark to get the extra levels on this game   it 's tough   it shows you just how hard it would be to be a secret agent there are two features about this game that i really like   the first is what i 'd like to call maim ability   if you shoot someone in the leg they 'll hold onto their leg same with the arm the head and even the groin   before this game the most you could hope for was that characters would bleed when they were shot and fall down when they 'd die still maim ability does n't mean that when you shoot them in the leg they wo n't be able to run again   they 'll limp for a few seconds and then be as good as new except take a lot less shots to kill some of the tougher characters take a lot of hits before they 're even to the point of getting to maim ability   you have to shoot the boss of the game 10 times in the head before he even shows signs of weakening the second thing i like about this game is the spy feel of it   you go on missions and you work with gadgets although some are indeed lame   but the cool thing is on some missions you 've got to be really quiet and sneaky   you sneak down halls and pick off unsuspecting guards one by one with well aimed shots   of course if you get bored of that you can always make a lot of noise have a bunch of guards come after you and blow everyone away this game is pretty realistic   there may be better games now but during its time this game was cutting edge stuff   it 's worth remembering even though it was hard as heck   i usually just like playing the easy levels and maiming bad guys quietly
golden eye is widely considered one of the best fps ever made it is a great solid game and i recommend this game to everybody
brings back memories of days long gone by as i 've turned from kid to teen from teen to young adult and some day to old man the nostalgia and memory of my childhood in the 90s becomes ever more appealing to me back in the days of summer vacations weekends off few worries and fewer obligations and responsibilities
this game may not have a lot of flashy features like sound or simulant multiplayer but who cares i bought this game in 1998 and i still play it i recommend it to anyone who likes first person shooters or a james bond fan
goldeneye 007 is not only the best movie tie in game of all time but it is perhaps the most influential first person shooter ever to hit the gaming console market   if you are n't aware of the plot of this game that 's not a problem because essential it is the same as the popular james bond movie goldeneye which was released in 1995- two years prior to this game 's release this is a game that is filled with techniques and styles that would be mimicked in many future games to come and it gives the player a wide variety of objectives and difficult challenges   the a.i. is smart especially on higher difficulty settings and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment as well as difficulty to any gamer the introduction of logical hit points on your enemies is a great feature   even bosses in this game can be taken down with a well aimed shot to the head   it is this type of realism that really makes you feel like your james bond and that you can sneak in sneak out covertly taking out henchmen as you go or springing alarms and having to go through massive shootouts   because of this there are many ways to beat the game and limitless possibilities for how you accomplish your tasks   aka you can take easy ways or hard ways of beating levels ... and if you do n't have a strategy guide you 'll have to find out those paths by yourself which i might add is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away).this is one of those games that the more you play it the more you 're able to value its contributions to the gaming industry   each time i play it i notice aspects that have been replicated in many following fps games   so if you have a nintendo 64 go ahead and dust that sucker and order a used copy of goldeneye 007 because trust me as a bond fan and a casual gamer i can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into the shoes of james bond or just have an awesome intense gaming experience.(also make sure to look out for its sister game perfect dark which is also on the n64 following the same controls and very similar weapon uses
hands down the best n64 game   goldeneye is very similar to the movie like the siberian dam mission the satellite control facility etc .. the graphics are the best i 've seen for the n64 except for zelda 64 the first one   the auto aim feature and 4-person multiplayer make the game perfect for the common area of a dorm room
goldeneye lookes like just another shootem up game but it is more than that goldeneye takes james bond to the next level pros graphics are great4 player is funlots of cheats to make the game even betteralot of characters to choose fromcons a little to easy to beatno voices during game playnot alot of multiplayer levelsin the end goldeneye is a great game and i recommend it to anyone
before this the racing games were race around a track and did not have to save the game   then when gt1 came out the racing really improved dramatically you can unlock cars tracks   plus you can save and you can upgrade in this one i believe   after this every game then racing games started to be like gt series   this is one of the best and most popular game series from sony   try this out
this is by far undeniably the racing game to have a game with over 20 cars to choose from unheard of at the time- this game 's got over 150 folks a game with true to life car physics sounds and handling get real right nope all here a game with so much customization import tuner companies piss their pants it 's all here gran turismo is the original racing simulator that started it all you start off with a measly 10,000 bucks that all but gets you a clunker of a car which after beating a bunch of driver 's ed tests you can use to sneak your way through a few races .... winning a bit of cash and some cars you can either sell or save to tune later .... until you can finally buy your dream car which for me was the acura nsx type s zero the first time i played through it)let me just stress how perfect this game is .... sure your first time through it you 'll take a hairpin turn at grand valley way too fast spin out of control scream yell and curse at the tv maybe throw and break your controller as you finish in last place .... but over time you 'll feel so much utter control of your car that any shimmy or shake the car makes while cornering or countersteering or powersliding you 'll know exactly how to correct it no two cars in the game handle the same you have your ff fr mr and 4wd drivetrains simply you have it all here the graphics in the game push the playstation to the limit .... this gt2 and r4 ridge racer type 4 are by far the best looking racing games on the original playstation there are hordes of races to race and multiple cars to win so the replay value is through the roof my absolute favorite part about the game is fine tuning the gear ratios of a fully tuned supercharged turbo monster of a car and trying to get every last ounce of power out of it for a top speed at the test track i 've literally spent days at a time fiddling with the gear ratios on a car knowing that someway somehow i 'd be able to squeeze another 2 or 3 mph out of it not only that .... adjusting the car 's ride height affects top speed and acceleration too .... my personal best was achieving 274 mph with the mitsubishi gto twin turbo mr .... it took me at least 8 hours to get it from its standard 252 mph top speed it gets with all of the top performance parts and no fiddling with gear ratios or anything .... the one and only downside to the game is that you only get 12,000 for any car you sell that you won from a tournament even a car that you know should rake in way more than just 12k .... like say for instance the tvr cerbera lm.other than that this game is absolute perfection 10 out of 10 ....
i was looking for a racing video game for my new playstation and everyone i talked to told me to get gran turismo   and now i know why   it 's so fun   it 's challenging but not impossible   the graphics are good and realistic and there are tons of cars to choose from   i really like the simulation mode where you can race for money and buy new cars or upgrade old ones   i 'm a huge fan of my dodge viper with racing stripes one thing that 's not so great about this game is the space that it takes up on your memory card   just to have a simulation mode game going you need 5 empty blocks   if you want to get into saving replays and stuff it can use up to 15 blocks   memory cards are expensive ... i 'm not willing to devote an entire memory card to one game no matter how great it is
i play this game with the interact wheel this game is very fun not as good as the other ones thoe 8/10
always love gran turismo so i wanted the ones from ps1 this came in good condition and with all the manuals too pretty sweet this game is almost 15 years old and it 's still around
graphics 8/10 you can see some of the computerised effects you crash or something but all of the graphics in this game look good and give feel to the competition sound 8/10 there could be a bit more commotion when you crash or flip or something but the engines vrooming gives you a thrill and the creaking sound of the breaks is eye widening value 10/10 -this game is seriously worth the money the word value is essential when buying a game and you get your money 's worth and more in short get it now!overall 9/10 fabulously entertaining and complex car game that really lives up to its reputation you 'll be playing it in your sleep
this game does seem a bit lacking after playing the other games in the franchise but holds up well if you do n't mind the graphics buyer beware   watch out for copies that do n't read greatest hits on   seems there was a bug that would n't allow you to get 100 in the game   these copies alway have been known to wipe out your garage
when this game came out i was a pimply faced highschool kid all i wanted was a car heck even a drivers license would do the closest thing i could get to driving a real car was playing games like well ... playing games like .... ummm well ... there were no games even close to driving a real car!then one day at funcoland i picked up a magazine and read about this new game comming out called gran turismo and how it was the ultimate car game they used real cars and physics to make the game that much authentic it was the closest a pimply faced highschool kids dream come true this was n't just another mash the gas driving game ... this was a revolutionary driving experience i slapped my 20 bucks down on a preorder that day when gran turismo was realised ... it changed all driving games as you know it all i remember was this being the first driving game that took cars seriously and i do n't know about you but the first time i loaded in that disk and saw all those car names flashing across the screen i almost wet my pants in exctasy this was the driving game i had been waiting for my entire life!never had there been so much detailed paid to a vehicle in a game i mean everysingle aspect was there even a car wash i have no idea how many hours i spent playing that game but took up heaps of my time afterschool the game was an instant legend and if you did n't own it did n't play it or did n't know someone who had or did you might as well as hung yourself with your sega saturn power chord the game was just that good even to this day i do n't think anything has quite impacted or revolutionized racing games ... other than the idea of online game play but this was the game that gave birth to it all sure over the years there have been many platform editions of the game but there is only one true gran turismo and that 's the original if your looking for this game today its because you want to add it to your ps1 collection and this is a game well worth having if you missed out on it as for me i have my memory cards sitting in the garage just incase someone wants to challenge my dodge viper gts r one day
this is the very first gran turismo game made it is very fun and allot easier than the others there r so many different cars in this game not even close to the amount as the newer ones but it has allot for the first game the graphics r good for the ps1 but i have seen better the cars slow down every time they hit a wall so that is one thing i hate and most of the tracks r only ment for a couple racers not six or more that makes the track very hard to race on in the quick race it lets u get better but it only has about twenty cars and ten tracks but it is fun if u play it on multiplayer that is the reason that i like this game so much it has a great multiplayer it does get boring after awhile but it is a fun game
i bought this game as i wanted to complete my gt collection i have been looking for a while to find this game at a reasonable price and amazon did n't let me down in finding it i have played it and it is n't the best compared to today 's standards but i have it more or less to complete the collection
first of all i am from guatelama back then in 1998 i was saving to get my nintendo 64 system but one day my older brother went to a videogame store planning to by the 64 with mario i had already sold my snes and i was just waiting to begin collecting stars then when my bro came by he was carrying a bag with a playstation box and a rare game called gran turismo i was really mad until he connected it and when the sony logo appeard i was shocked sound graphics etc from the video of gran turismo the presentation to my first race that was it i forgot everything about nintendo except of killer instinct but that s how it started the other gran turismos are obviolusly better but this is the one that made the leap like mgs ffvii and all those awesome ps1 games that changed how we play right now gran turismo is that kind of game that not everyone loves specially the arcade ones but its simply amazing the best of its kind and time by that time a nfs normaly had no more than 15 20 cars and this changed it forever with more than 160 cars if you want a realistic experience buy a ps3 and gran turismo 5 and after that you 'll want to have the collection i have passed the 5 of them including the prologue it takes time but that why i am paying characteristics:+ 160 cars and customizable first time in history11 detailed tracksreal phisicsbest racing graphics until gran turismo 2 and so on.most realistic control until .... gt2 and so on toothe best quaility in menus and a revolutionary simulation mode also an arcade mode first time ever replays and to save you replay too simply a classic
i played this game for the first time some thirteen years ago and i was blown away in the days of 32 bit graphics on playstation this was as good as it was going to get for car games while ea had the arcady need for speed franchise sony and polyphony digital 's first foray into simulation racing was absolutely fantastic as the first entrant into the series that is now up to gt5 i do n't care what the negative reviews say that game is great this shines as the title that started it all i wo n't go into the nuances of the game here because others have done so before me if you are chronologically inclined like i tend to be and you want to start the series at its genesis before moving on to the later games there is no better place to start that right here at gt1 be forewarned of course that the graphics on your hd tv will be a little lacking ... ok a lot lacking with all the cars setups tracks and races to make up for it the now suspect graphics wo n't matter at all get ready for the first drive of your life
effortlessly dusting the competition gran turismo flashes past the finish line with slick controls and stellar gameplay it 's easily the best of the playstation 's realistic racing games starting off in the garage turismo scores big with 166 real life cars ranging from the lowly honda civic to the high end dream machines like the corvette viper and toyota castrol supra the excellent selection of tracks delivers plenty of variety and turismo performs like a winner with no draw in speedy load times and blazing fast action but gameplay is where turismo really rocks a fast pick up and play arcade mode along with topnotch two player split screen racing positions turismo at the head of the pack for casual racing fans and hardcore racers who delve into the amazing sim mode will uncover impressive depth it 's almost like fantasy league racing you test for licenses participate in a wide array of events buy and maintain as many cars as you can afford and even upgrade their performances with a vast multitude of parts need for speed iii may have more flash but turismo 's got more game it 's one of the must buy titles of this summer
this by far one of the best gran turismo on ps1 driving the skyline with 947hp wow i still remember my supra back in 2001 on my brothers old ps1 i used to watch my brother play this game and winning the races and selling cars he would always race on the test track and the ring speedway track i still do it on my ps3 ..
the very first grand theft auto is likely the most forgotten and for good reasons though there is fun to be had in this game it is marred by one of the worst control schemes i have ever experienced the top down camera is awful and the combat mechanics suck the graphics are quite ugly as well the overall presentation is a mess because of poor development skills the development team had apparently like i said this title is passable overall but it is marred by some huge issues which is probably why it 's forgotten
this is the original that started it all if you can you past the fact that it is quite dated you will absolutely love everything about this title the gameplay is rock solid and the game moves really fast camera is great as the whole game is viewed from a bird 's eye perspective the game is very open ended and you will never get bored while playing this
the first installment in the gta franchise this game is awsome the story is simple and the gameplay is fun
grand theft auto circa 1997good:- the roots or start of a super popular franchise- sort of fun and different in it 's own waybad:- really really dated graphics even for its day- gameplay is pretty old and controls can be tough for somewill it fit your taste:- a top down run and gun game where you steal cars kill people and live a life of crimegame its most assocated too:- grand theft auto london 1969- grand theft auto 2- the legend of zelda a link to the past but a lot more urban and violent)additional notes:- there is a version of this game for game boy advance- there is a version of this game that comes packed with grand theft auto london 1969- all three levels or cities in this game later on became their own grand theft auto game example the first level is liberty city which is the city from gtaiii the second level is vice city which is the same city from gta vice city and last but not least is the third level san andreas which is the same city state for gta san andreas
i just wanna review out something no ones said yet if you still ever play this game it is a great game it 's 5 stars provided your into this sort of thing but recently when i played the playstation version i noticed they jibbed out and did nt include certain things that the pc version and better version had first off there is no train the pc version has a fully working train that you can hijack and even put into reverse .. sure it may be useless to crash into another train but it was entertaining the ps version does nt have a train .. but yet it has the tracks for it so go figure that one out next lack of vehicles the pc version does nt have spots where cars just disapeer and it feels like your walking around a ghost town and something no one can say would nt be better ... you can edit the pc version not only can you put whatever car you want into the game by downloading a simple quick device them importing a car you can download or make yourself but you can also change everything in the game with simmilar tools you can not just add cars you can add missions put more cars into things edit the exsisting map or hell make your own city from scratch when i play this game i like to ride around in knight rider or maybe the general lee try and eulude cops driving lambourghinis ... gouranga!convinced the pc versions better makes you feel like the psx you played was lacking huh
i remember when my parents got me this game for christmas 8 years ago that was good times liberty city 's based on new york city featuring brocklyn based on brooklyn kings based on queens brix based on bronx manhaddan based on manhattan but no island based on staten island   liberty city 's bordered by the garden state of new guernsey based on the garden state of new jersey   very decent graphics by 1997 standards   realistic car controls   realistic gun fights   no so realistic fist fights   good music   there are 2 more cities to unlock such as the unidentified city in the golden state of san andreas based on san francisco california and vice city in the sunshine state of florida based on miami florda   so get out there grab a car and have some fun
this is where it all started if your and old school gamer you 've probably already played this and if not it is a great game if your a gta fan but have n't played this it is a must to truly understand how great and innovated this series is and has become if your not a fan of old school gaming though you may not like it
the original grand theft auto was a classic for the pc but it 's gleefully unabashed violence simple graphics dark humor and addictive gameplay garnered the game much appeal and controversy   eventually take 2 interactive now they 're called rockstar published gta on as many systems as it could the ps1 dreamcast and even the game boy color   these days anyone and everyone are gta nuts but only when it comes to gta 3 or vice city   the original gta may seem simple enough but it is undeniably fun for the most part no matter how simplistic the graphics seem   the missions can get rather tedious and the fact you ca n't save your progress in game a problem which would be corrected in gta 3 and eventually you 'll lose interest but for the most part the original gta is still loads of fun   those who have only played gta 3 or vice city will not like this original installment but it 's a great ride while it lasts
i dunno ... i loved the concept but the control kills it   i do nt like having to push a gas button to walk   thankfully they fixed this in gta 3 amp 4   those games are incredible   buy those asap!!i am giving the game 3 stars for having to cojones to bring this kind of gaming to the world
and you just became part of it pros brought violence and profanity in videogames to a whole new levelvery good sound effectslong enjoyable levels and misionsa short but destructable arsenoalvery useful cheat codes(despit i usally do n't cheat)pretty good musiccons the graphics are plain out horribleone shot death(a bit too realistic)well unless you have armorcan't save until you beat a leveldefinitly not for kidsthe game suffers from slowdowns if too many things are on the screenin 98 this game was jst a instant classic despite being overshadowed by loads of games(especially metal gear solid and zelda ocorina of time   it 's definitly unknown since gta 3 and vice city overshadowed it by a loooong mile but yet i still play this game from time to time   in this game you could even say ... the police and let them eat the gat take out a squad of them with a machine gun blaze them up with a flame thrower or just blow them away with almighty rocket launcher(that was propably the main reason this game got a lot of heat form contaversy   if you 're used to gta 3 or vice city then this game will hardly be interesting to you but if you have this game then i 'm sure you appreciate the joy the classic burng to you and took you on the crazy ride from this all the way to vice city final words speaking of vice city that was one of the levels in this game and so was liberty city and san anderess is the last city   could san andress be the next grand theft auto   hmmmm ... peace
this game has all the violence and language of the current popular grand theft auto games packing into a convenient 2d package :)
this was the first real game i ever played along with the first i ever owned despite the fact that i 've grown out of many kids games and spend my time focused on m rated games with a lot of violence or sexual themes this is one of those games i most definitely have not grown out of i love the tracks the weapons the characters(yoshi 's my favorite and simplely how much fun this game still delivers to this very day the replay value is endless and multiplayer is still very engaging(it 's always fun to humiliate your friends at this game this game is what got me started on games and it will continue to be one of my most memorable games in my life as a gamer
it has spawned such classic levels as i recall such as luigi 's circuit moo moo farm frappe 's snowland toad 's turnpike koopa troopa beach banshee highway bowser 's infamous castle wario 's stadium and the ridiculously long and bright track rainbow road which has spawned at least 5 different versions throughout the series!my all time favorite level in the game is actually sherbet land it 's filled with ice and is just fun to cruise through and the penguins that you can run into are so cute!the playable characters are your basic eight mario balance luigi balanced princess peach lightweight toad lightweight yoshi advanced donkey kong heavyweight wario heavyweight and bowser the heavi"est"weight).this game is very very easy to just pick up and play with friends the controls are simple as all get out and the characters look pretty cool for a n64 game the sounds they make are cool too!if you want something that 4 guys and/or girls can enjoy this is the right move pros -bright colorful boards.-addicting sound effects.-semi interesting characters.-fun tracks.-4-way battle nuff said.-8 semi unique characters cons -sound comes through in 1-player or 2-player mode but fails to when playing with 2 or 3 friends-16 levels just is n't enough to satisfy the average gamer 's thirst the music can be annoying nauseating to some when you 're in 1st you get crappy items when you 're last you get the best ones usually landing you in 1st/2nd/3rdcons aside i spent countless hours with friends that i cherished playing this game it will bring smiles to your faces for months to come if you like this and own a nintendo ds or a ds lite shame on all of you who do n't then i totally recommend mario kart ds also more levels and more mayhem did i mention even more characters?!4.5 stars
even with all the improvements in systems games graphics etc this one remains a classic in all sense of the word
people say goldeneye was a much multiplayer than this game but i 've spent more happy hours racing my friends in mario kart 64 than blowing people up with proximity mines in the complex in goldeneye lots of people extol the graphics in goldeneye but graphics in mario kart 64 is better first of all it has a lower polygon count and the characters look much better the gameplay is simple but that only means it 's easier to learn the card that comes with the game tells you everything you need to know so all you have to do is plop the game inside the console and start playing so the characters do n't say much it 's mainly just a simple quot;yippee!&quot or quot;i'm a wario and i'm a gon na win!,&quot but there 's much more in game speech than goldeneye sound effects are fine too the soundtrack is excellent it ranges from coutry to smooth jazz even some major critics of video game music i know have said that the music here is great you know koji kondo 's doing something right hearing that mario kart 64 is addicting with four players and it can be addicting with one player too the time trials may be a little disappointing but the mario gp had me coming back for more the game is one of the best racing games on the n64 it 's better than waverace diddy kong racing f zero x and even excitebike 64 heck it 's one of the best games on the n64 if you have n't played this game then you do n't know what you 're missing
this was the first kart game quite like this .. there is n't any kart game like this either outside of the mario franchise if you think you can find a better karting game out there i 'd like to see you find it and show me because from my finds and plays this is the only game that is worth playing from dk to bowser peach to toad this game has most of the characters that have been involved with mario in some way the graphics are great for its time the sound is fun the worlds are colorful the idea is great who would n't like this game- at any age i 'm not sure but if you do n't you amy need to see a doctor this is the best kart game ever and the best mario kart game ever
i have loved this game from day 1 i was happy to find it and receive it quickly and safely
cool game but i think toad is the fastest of the crew i usedto be an expert at it i was even born an expert ....
excellent game all around except one thing .... the game cheats.you can be in first place and magically all the computer controlled racers somehow manage to catch up to you anyway now if you 're in last place you literally have no chance of catching up not fair not cool that aside .... if you develop your skills you 'll still win after much practice i still managed to beat the game even though it blatantly cheats great graphics every character you love from the mario universe i think toad is my favorite when he gets hit lol the noise he it makes is hilarious the courses are inventive and enjoyable the music fits in perfectly did i mention it cheats?that 's my only complaint otherwise another five star winner from nintendo highly recommended
this is a must have for your n64   it is fun to play by yourself but the most fun is when you play with 1 3 friends   :)   the graphics are not the greatest but it usually does n't affect the gameplay   a classic n64 game
i used to play this game all the time when i was a kid i recently came into an n64 and just had to get it game works perfectly and it arrived quickly
this is an excellent game once you start playing you can not stop until you actually beat it this has averythingn a good game should have excellent graphics excellent gameplay good2-player mode and good sound the only flaw in this game is ... well ... their are no flaws this game gets a solid 5 thanks for reading my review happy gaming p.s. do n't buy pokemon snap ... thanks
truly a classic this game was one of the first i got for the n64 and it is one of my favorites today as it gives graphics that were hardly ever seen in the early n64 days it also has gameplay almost unmatched by the games of it 's era the sound is moderate but sound is nt a very big facter in deciding the rating of the game a followup on the early snes version that was also a hit this game was certainly watched before it 's release date as it stormed into the n64 world and took many fans as you can see from it 's very high review in many chances right away it was considered as a very high class game then and now too many of the n64 owners today have one in their hands and many of those have played the game for over 24 hrs this game has wonderful graphics and sound for the era that it was made in the size of a typical game back then but with the technical advancements of some of the games today the graphics are very good as you can distinguish all characters and objects faster than immediatly the game also shows no slow down rate no matter how many characters or items are on the screen at the same time   the sound is entertaining for a while and it is different for almost all of the 16 courses showing wonderful compositions with goofy sound added noises at parts the gameplay is also great you may pick one of 8 characters to race with on a small go cart you must race on one of the 16 courses and try to get in first there are many modes you can race with a group of 8 racers in a grand prix mode where you may race a total of 4 races and accumulate points a vs. mode race will put you against a friend or 2 or 3 in a single race there is also a battle mode which will put you against 1 to 3 other players where the last one alive wins the items in the game play a big part some will boost your speed while some are used to slow down enemies some steal enemies items and some let you do things such as go invincible or invisible most of the however are used to smash your opponents into the air and slow them down in battle it will be used as one of 3 hits to destroy the enemy the characters are the typical mario game characters   mario luigi peach toad yoshi wario dk and bowser they should all come in handy sometime in the game and it should be fun to test them all overall this game is great for having fun i reccommend it to any one great for technology too this game is right for you
this is a really cool game i played this to death i do n't know how many times sometimes alone and at times with a partner it 's really tragic if you do n't have this game when you own an n64 you do n't know what you 're   missing out on um ... well this game is pretty easy and you do n't really   need a strategy guidebook for this one i think the only reason why it 's so   damn fun is because on every track and race you can race it differently   you can try new tricks or even attempt to create your own shortcut if you   are that good!graphics wise it 's all a let down i was expecting   realistic models but i got cartoony characters but then again- it 's mario   and friends right?as a mario fan- you 'll want to have this in your   hands and if you 're not- then play this as a party game it beats mario   party in replay value but is somewhat less challenging so bottomline-   it 's a little too easy but that will not prevent it from being a top 100   game of all time read egm 100 ....
this game is one of two reasons to buy an n64   it 's excellent multiplayer with enough shortcuts and tricks to perfect that 's it 's also a great solo game   if you have an n64 and you do n't have this game then you should stop wasting your time and go out and buy it   you could play the other games but they are terrible ...
this is the best racing game i 've ever played and the most funest the game has a cool unique to a racing game it is tons of fun and you can play either mario luigi peach the princess toad yoshi bowser(king koopa donkey kong there are three types of trophies you can recieve either the mushroom trophy flower trophy star trophy and a special trophy cool hu well this game was tons of fun i recomend it to everyone peace outif you liked this game then check out all of the mario games
ahhhh i love this game it 's so great my friend gave it to me and i fell in love with it fast i played mario kart for the snes and thought it was the best thing since sliced bread when i found out mario kart was for n64 i went bezerk this was the first game to my n64 collection you choose between 8 characters you can get over 10 different powerups including the legendary star which makes you invincible banana peels which make opponents skid out of control lightning bolts which makes characters small so you can smush them mushrooms that boost your engine and 3 kinds of shells a green shell will go and bounce off anything a red shell will do its best to find a character and smash them and a spike shell with automatically find the player in 1st place and destroy them without fault the reason it is 4 stars is because they did n't go the extra mile if you play 1 or 2 player(s you can do a grand prix but not with 3 or 4 in player 1 mode you ca nt do a battle or do a vs. with the cpu battle only contains 4 tracks i guess what i 'm trying to say is that i wish it was more open taking shortcuts wo n't work because lukita drags you back when your at the top of the mountain this game would be the best if you were allowed to do more
when i had this game i did not stop playing until i got to winning the game it 's fun for awhile to throw objects at people that are racing against you it has a four player mode which is not bad but sometimes gets a little confusing when you 're watching other people racing the split screen should never be included although that it is which is easy to get distracted but mario kart is fun and it should be in one of the hand held games too i would n't mind playing this oh i have the one on gameboy advance which is cool but not like the one from nintendo 64 now that confused me
it plays great and i look forward to beating my fance we place bets on who will win and the looser has to do the chores
mario kart 64 is by far the best n64 gameif you want non violent racing with all the nintendo characters for a good price- look no furtheralso if you like mario kart 64 you might likemario kart dsmario kart super curcuitmario kart snes
mario kart 64 the sequel to the first mario kart game on the snes is great nintendo got rid of some of the things that made the snes title so much fun but added a lot too the gameplay is much more enhanced the characters look much better and the individual go karts are very realistic like the snes version this game includes 3 modes of play gp grand prix battle and time trial in gp you choose one of 8 characters mario luigi peach toad wario yoshi donkey kong and bowser in a large variety of courses in the mushroom cup flower cup star cup or special cup which you unlike by getting gold trophies in each of the 3 basic courses in 50cc 100cc or 150cc mode 50cc is the easiest but in 100cc and 150cc the computer gets much faster and more challenging there are several items you can collect by driving through the question mark boxes which help you during each race lightning bolts the rarest item to get makes all of the other opponents small mushrooms give you a speed burst banana peels make one of your opponents crash if they slip on it red shells are used to shoot directly at an opponent to get them off course and green shells keep bouncing off the walls until it hits one of the racers unlike the snes mairo kart game there are several objects you need to avoid to stay on course in different races there are trucks and cars that will make you crash if you hit them snowmen that will blow up if you hit them and many other obstacles in different courses in battle mode you and up to 3 others choose one of the 8 characters you drive around a course trying to pop each other 's 3 balloons you can pop their balloons by shooting red or green shells at them or throwing banana peels at them to make them slip you can also use the other items to avoid being hit by them once all of your balloons are popped you become a bomb which you can drive around the course trying to run in to the other players this mode is a lot of fun especially if you get tired of continually playing grand prix mode in time trial mode you race in any of 15 courses and try to set records for each lap and/or race the controls for mario kart 64 are very simple and easy to master and the music and sound effects are great as well if you want a great racing game for your n64 i highly recommend that you check out mario kart 64
it 's a classic anyone that has a n64 should have this game
classic racing game if you love racing games you should consider getting this game you race around tracks throwing random stuff so that you can win the graphics are great-- i mean during that time the graphics are great you ca n't really argue about that
graphics 9/10 eye catching bold and pretty mario kart 64 's graphics are fulfilling and nice to look at sound 8/10 lots of bells whistles engines and da da 's in this game they are just small sound but bring out some sort of livelihood value 8/10 even though i do n't have a nintendo 64 if i did i would probably buy this game because it is lots of fun to play it can also be very strategic at times which is good for a racing car game overall 8/10 nothing too memorable but it 's delightfully entertaining to play when you are actually using the controls mario kart 64 gives you things to do and stuff to work out it 's the first game i played on nintendo 64 and as far as i 'm concerned it 's well worth the time
this game is really fun but i honestly enjoyed crash team racing for the playstation a lot more one thing that annoys me about this game is that you ca n't look behind you i pressed every button and i ca n't get the camera to face behind the racer and this makes it impossible to shoot green turtle shells from behind without proper aiming so nine out of ten times i 'm going to miss my target how did nintendo screw up this badly and the racers are pre rendered much like how donkey kong and diddy kong were in donkey kong country for the snes i was wondering why was n't it computer generated like super mario 64 it 's still a nice little game a little pricey but still nice to have in your n64 collection
mario kart 64   it is such an improvement from the super nintendo version   the graphics are quite detailed in comparison to the other 64 games out   i would say above average   however the graphics is not what sets this game off above the others   it is the enjoyment level!not only is it fun to compete with others like your family friends or even the computer player ai but it 's got a great grand prix mode in which you can compete for a gold cup   get all gold cups and you gain a bonus the only complaint i have about this game reason why i gave it a four instead of a 5 is that the ai are too smart   races sometimes seem to be unfair   you throw items at them knock them to the side speed ahead of them and it seems like whatever you do it does n't matter   this can be frustrating   though the controls are way improved over the super nintendo version it still is hard to control the carts karts around corners overall this is an addicting game have a super nintendo buy mario kart for super nintendohave a gamecube definetely buy mario kart double dash for gamecube and finally if you have a n64 mario kart 64 is one to deeply consider
after checking gamespot 's author 's note this was originally posted exclusively on gamespot.com and a few user reviews i absolutely had to throw my two cents in i could n't help but laugh when i read the introduction of even with all its bells and whistles mario kart 64 is very likely to disappoint you after about a week "when i picked up this game initially my thoughts were sweet a new super mario kart i unfortunately never had an snes of my own so my fixes came in the form of time at my friend 's house this game is absolutely spectacular in every way yes i do feel that it could benefit from maybe a higher difficulty level and there is also the fact that it 's possible to clinch a gold medal in a circuit 4 races after finishing in the top spot in each of the first three races however other than these minor spots i find it to be flawless everything from the graphics to the sound to the features are great there is also a great amount of multiplayer available in this with not only the up to four player split screen but the track ghosts as well track ghosts are saved data of your best race single player only on a course the game saves not only your time but your entire race when you race against your ghost you can actually compare yourself second by second on the tracks and this also helps you to analyze spots and what you did to help you become a better racer the items are what really make multiplayer fun though i 've had many a time where i have something such as a ghost which lets you steal and item and makes you invisible invincible while my friend had a lightning bolt shrinks all opponents and it 's a quick reaction race to see who can get their item deployed first to me however there is nothing more satisfying than hitting your opponent especially if it 's a friend instead of the computer with a green shell a shell that fires straight out as opposed to the red homing shells as he 's about to cross the finish line to win not just the race but the circuit as well and yes i actually did that to a friend of mine talk about bragging rights up to this point i have kept or at least tried to keep retro rating out of this review and i was considering dropping one of the five rankings to a 9 because i 'm stingy with giving out perfect 10 's if i had rated this game when it first came out it would probably be rated somewhere around 9.7 to 9.9 however there is one reason and one reason only that i still own my n64 -- and that is to play mario kart 64 ... a decade later note i ca n't even say that about zelda oot or goldeneye that in itself i think warrants the move up to the perfect 10 rating ... i guess this pretty much means that i 'll have to give super mario kart a 10 as well i guess we 'll see when i finally get it on virtual console for those of you who ask virtual console why read paragraph 2.)overall 10gameplay 10graphics 10sound 10value 10tilt 10
i bought mario kart 64 for my nephew for his birthday i played mario kart 64 when i was a little and i loved it my nephew already has mario kart ds and he loves it i figure that he will love this game too mario kart 64 has many different levels in which you can race other mario characters such as luigi wario donkey kong bowser and many others i would recommend this game to anyone who likes any of the newer mario kart games
this game is an old racing game but heck its better then half of them out now with all the crazy weapons it can keep you goin awile this game is really worth it if u have a nintendo 64.this is still 1 of my favorite games
mario kart 64 this game is fun you 'll play this over and over my favorite board is mushroom   level it 's easy that 's why and you pick up items to used from keeping your opponent from taking the lead great buy
i got this game in 97 and it is still fun to play unlike the original mario kart for the snes or the new mario kart super circuit for the gba both of these games you have to use a control pad to drive)you can use the control stick on the n64 controller ot drive your go kart which is a hundred times easier than a control pad the game is easy in the begining but it hets much harder as you get closer to finishing it the graphics are spectacular and so is the music in one course you can go off roading and drive around and look at princess toadstool 's castle form super mario 64 the tracks are cleverly designed and all to often you 'll find yourselft barely winning or completing a race the game does offer a good challenge with eight drivers to choose from which onclude the following and their speed mario average luigi average peach average toad fast yoshi fast donkey kong slow wario slow bowser slow the speeds come to play in the later levels where only toad and yoshi are your best bet for first place again with the gba and the gamecube which launched today as i am writing this mario kart 64 is a must have for n64 owners who ca n't get the gamecube or the gba for now also each character has his or her own course and the game has race and battle multiplayer modes where in the battle mode each racer has three balloons arround his or her go kart and everyone has to try to knock out everyones balloons have fun
this game was shipped quickly and was in very good condition   i have great memories of playing this game when i was young and now my son and i can make new memories   thanks very much
my favorite part of this game is the battle mode   my friend showed me all the tricks he has learned from playing it   like where to set traps and other stuff   the one player mode is fun too
mario kart on the n64 is an extremly well made game when one person plays the game for the first time the controls are easy and you do n't nead to worry about changing gears after you get better you can move on to harder levels of play once you beat the game on 150cc hardest level you can race al track in mirror mode all tracks have opposite turns then their original tracks the ads more replay value because the game in a sence has new tracks all the tracks are unique and have varied difficulty levels they are also well designed the graphics in mario kart are bright simple and full of color the music in the game is not very good but it does not mater because of the great sound effects provided by the characters as with all great n64 games this one accells in the multiplayer department it will appeal to people of all ages you can choose from 3 different multiplayer modes battle championship single race the most fun out of all of those is batlle because you go around getting items then try to hit your friends with any item you get if you hit your'e oponent they 'll lose a balloon they have 3 ballons this is a party game i would recommend over any mario party game and definitly over didy kong racing this is a classic n64 game no one shoild be without
i love all the mario kart games this one has some of the coolest tracks   yoshi valley is the best track i 've ever played and the graphics are pretty good too   small selection of characters if you 've got the one for gamecube but still a blast   awesome 1 player or multiplayer game a must have for parties   good anytime and that 's hard to find
this mario kart is my favorite of any in the series and i am so glad i bought it because i have had so much fun
this game i grew up with and enjoy very much i have been playing this game since i was 6 or 7 years old and games like these are very hard to come by right now and they cost a pretty penny brand new what i have is a like new version but unforutantely i lost the manuel and the box is long gone to mine but maybe i will find it one day while i shop around the internet i love this game and recommend this game to old school video game players and the like
the price was reasonable and the game shipped relatively quickly   most importantly it works   what else could you ask for
mario kart is definetly the most classical game ever for racing but maybe even the most classical game nintendo has ever made this game has three different levels one is data which keeps track of your best time for the particular track and you get three mushroom guys who give you a boost up forward but there are no diamonds to get a specialty like a star or something.(i'll explain about the special items later so you know what there for before you might play the game)in options you can see your data records for each track showing the best lap and the top 5 races in time with the particular racer on it(not names instead they show mario peach bowser wario yoshi dk luigi and my personal favorite which is toad only do for one player!another one of the things you can do in mario kart is do mario kart g.p where you compete with all the other racers while picking your own before you start the screen will show 4 different brackets which have 4 tracks each and you pick the bracket you want after each race it 'll show the score of each racer in points which goes that if you place 5th through 8th you get no points 4th gets 1 3rd gets 3 2nd gets 6 and 1st gets 9 at the end of the of all the races the top three racers will stand on that olympic where it says 1,2,and 3 ranging as 1 the highest and 3 the lowest after it shows the three racers om each of their spots it will show a trophy to you in bronze silver or gold and then   your player says something like yeah oh yeah their are diamonds in this mode then their is a single game which you only play one game against the computer or against friends at any course you or your friend wants to play at finally which you might 've been waiting to hear is about the freaking diamonds while your racing their will be diamonds around and if you go through one it will show a box showing which specialty you 've gotten the long list of specialties are one red shell which if you throw at someone within a certain distance they will fly up and back down making you get ahead also there 's a 3 red shell specialty where it shows three red shells going around your car and it does the same thing as 1 red shell would do the green shells are totally opposite from the red one it comes in threes and ones and when you throw it will just bounce off the sides of the course back and forth going preety slow but preety much the only way you can hit another player with a green shell is if the racer is almost or is right in front of you but the bowser shell which you do nt get often but if you do get it you can throw it from anywhere and it will get the closest player ahead of you but if your in first place the shell is worthless also preety much everybody 's favorite specialty is the star where you can go really fast to catch up for about 10 seconds and if your it by anything it 'll just back off of you and you will stay up because you can do that the game also lets you knock people over if you headed straight at them and bumped them sorry if this is boring but if you want to hear about the game and you will buy it you should listen to the rest you get bananas in 8 's and 1 's bananas you just drop on the ground and racers might crash into them and start slipping on the floor the last specialty is ghost where nobody can see you and if a specialty hits you you will just keep one going my favorite mode is battle where you have to have 2 or more players in battle their are 4 different modes during battle you have 3 ballons with diamonds on the ground when you get hit you lose a ballon and when you have lost all three ballons you become a bomb to go get other players   as a bomb you ca nt get any specialties but if you bump in to any racers you will be done as a bomb but that racer will lose a ballon by the way computers can not play in this mode this should be enough to know how this game is and i hope that you buy this game because you will probably like it this game is a classic which i 've said before p.s ... good bye and have a nice day
probably a top three game as far as popularity is concerned on the n64 just a simple racing game with the original mario cast but a game that was a lot of fun multiplayer mode was even better as it made for real good fun competition amongst friends truly a classic game that is a must for n64 collection
mario kart 64 is one of that games that is hard to find but that effort has a very good reward 'cuz this is one o'that games that began the real 4-player madness you know ... it 's also considered as one of the best mario kart games ever better than mario kart double dash and maybe as good as mario kart wii the only thing that i did n't give the 5/5 is that this game is a bit tedious yes i know that graphics ... forget about the graphics 'cuz first it 's the n64 and second graphics are not important in this game that focus on fun if you have a 64 and you do n't have already mk64 you must find it now everybody with a 64 must have this crazy great game do n't forget four controllers for the real madness
the original mario kart for the snes was fun and a good effort for the limited capabilities of the snes platform mario kart 64 made full use of the n64 's 3-d capabilities making for a very fun and successful game up to four players can engage in the game and the racecourses are as colorful and rich as they are varied each character has their own racecourse peach 's castle bowser 's castle yoshi 's canyons donkey kong 's jungle and so on and so forth plus more that are just fun and varied like a beach the desert snowfields and the rainbow road you can play against the computer and compete for various cups and each set of courses has various levels of difficulty you get cool items to aid your progress on the track or hinder the progress of others there is also a vs mode where two to four players can battle against one another overall this is a really great game for the nintendo 64
i remember i was 6 and i had just gotten a nintendo 64 at such a young age most of the games out were too complicated for me and i had to find something i could understand enter mario kart 64 this game is pure and simple you pick a character and race with seven other famous nintendo stars in 16 detailed for n64 anyway stages this was one of the n64 's first games so for me it turned the system into a classic which i still play today this game was much better than super mario kart and much better than double dash in this game you can choose from 50cc 150cc which is n't much and depending on your speed this could be very boring or the ride of your life i mean seriously who would n't want to speed down yoshi valley at 200 mph for its time in 96 this game was amazing and i still play it today i am 15 now so it has an enormous replay value and the only stage i do nt like is banshee boardwalk if you have a nintendo 64 which not many people do then buy this now
this is one of the best games out for the n64   the races and tournaments themselves are challenging and extremely fun   the many characters that you can unlock all have their own abilities and everything else to set them aside   the tracks are not repetitive and give each race a fresh new layer of fun multi player is an even better experience ... who could imagine that battles with cars and turtle shells would actually be fun   well it is fun and will keep you playing for hours on end   this game will make your friends ask if they can come over and play   a sure hit with a gamer of any age
for nintendo some of their most popular games have been revised over and over again in the case of the nintendo 64 the case has happened to itself too the 1997 mario kart 64 game is no acception the starting flag proves that the light is worth checking out in this game you play any of eight characters in 16 traditional courses and 4 battle zones choose from mario yoshi wario peach luigi toad donkey kong and bowser the graphics are a bit more intact than the other racing games that came later for the system although it might try to drown you out a little bit at a time when you complete the four racing cups quickly luckily the game truly makes up for it in the vs mode where you are head to head n a battle with up to four players in the race mario kart is absolutely worth checking out for the nintendo 64 despite the fact the nintendo 64 has no more new games for the system if you buy it only for yourself your better off bringing in a partner for the ride
i played this game for week 's years ago against a friend or 2 and it was great fun on multi player however when i played it one player i hated it i thought it was too slow and real dodgy but that was before i actually sat down and gave it a real go and once you master the sliding skid turn booster trick it becomes a lot better to do that you just hold the r button down when going around bends and corners and tap the analogue stick in the opposite direction 3 times the smoke goes from white yellow to red then you let go the r and you have a slight boost once i had learned that it plays a lot faster overall the graphics good and the levels are much bigger then the previous snes version but it lacks the same competitiveness and fun of the original version but do n't get me wrong it is great for playing with friends but it is a different feel from the original in my opinion the best mario kart out is the gba version because it is the snes version with more tracks the original snes tracks are unlockable in the gba version but none the less this version stands out on it 's own this version i did n't find to be as fun as the snes one for a few reasons they should have had more racers to choose from and i miss my favourite driver the little koopa trooper instead he 's been taken out to make way for a slower wario but once i 'd mastered that thing to take corners with it was easy to place 1st in the 150cc overall i give the one player game 3 stars and the multiplayer 4.cons not enough tracks and courses once you 've mastered the courses on 150cc there is no further challenges for you in single player mode.- not enough drivers to choose.- the sound effects can be very annoying after a while like toads whoa whoa whoa whoa sound)- no way to turn the objects off like banana peels and the hazards of the coarse ... it is really unfair sometimes
this is my favorite of the series my cousin and i used to play it all the time and it is how i remember hit detection is a little off
like many other people i absolutely adore racing games and the mario games   then i saw this come out   it was perfect   it was a racing game with the characters from the super mario series   i was so excited to play it   my friends and i played it all night   it was so addicting   in fact i still play this game today
mario kart 64 is an excellent game i love the graphics the creators at nintendo 64 made them very specific my favorite modes to play in are either mario gp because i love racing against the computer or battle because you have to be alert and careful not to run into in obstacles like bananas or shells i really like the quot;ghost&quot so you can see whether or not you beat your previous time with that course my favorite course is yoshi valley because in many areas there are no walls to keep you from falling so it 's a challenge and i like the big squasher egg the one thing that drives me crazy is the fact that the computer can manage to get in front of me while racing without me noticing or even knowing how they did it other than that this is a great game with excellent graphics and fun for the whole family i hope you enjoyed my review
this mario kart changed all mario karts in the future this is the first mario kart that has mini games and computer generated graphics i mean the 64 as u can tell the graphics have changed allot from the snes this mario kart has many more features and great graphics the sound is great also if i had a choice of which mario kart to have for free if i did not have any of them it would be this one i do nt know why but for some reason this one is really fun it has a great multiplayer especially on mini games
if you liked mario kart for the super nintendo then you will love mario kart 64.this is an amazing game one of the best for the 64 if you have competition around you can take up hours of play time i have played this game almost as much as i have golden eye 64 but not quite as much if you are looking for a good quality game with a very high replay value then this is a great game to check out doesn't matter if you are 10 or 70 you can get into this game the multi player makes things a little bit more interesting the battle mode is the best feature if you have equal level competition
if you like racing games that are unique this is for you you can race by yourself or with a friend not only that but you can also challenge your friends in battle mode with some really fun arenas if your more of a solo player like me do n't worry there are four different tournaments that you can play you can even use different items either to slow down the other racers or to help you pass them up of course every item has it 's own effects there are a few that are hard to get that 's because they 're special learn how to use them and the competition will be eating your dust and last but far from least there is a special mode you can unlock for an even bigger challenge yeah this game will keep you busy no matter how you play it 's definately a must have order it while you can
mario kart 64 is without a doubt one of the best games ever made for the nintendo 64 or any other system even today 8 years after its original release mario kart 64 is still amazingly fun the controls are perfect- and i do mean perfect the first time you go power sliding around a sharp turn you 'll see what i mean the game is perfectly balanced- each character has strengths and weaknesses your skill determines if you come in first- not because you picked the best character oh and i have n't even spoken about the brilliant course design every course has shortcuts and special features making them truely unique the placement of the powerups is wonderful and the multiplayer ... oh the multiplayer one word brilliant playing with your friends is exciting competetive and will have you laughing like crazy this is what multiplayer gaming is all about if the game does have one weakness it is the graphics being 8 years old mario kart 64 does n't stack up well against today 's crop of games in terms of visuals but when you 're having this much fun with a game do the graphics matter no way even if you own the gamecube version of mario kart you still owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of this timeless classic
i 'd recommend buying it used to save some money   the tracks are nice and the game play is all right   it 's just not the same as playstation racing games though
mario kart is not fun there is no secret characthers or secret places[i think i tried the game for an hour and was completly bored now i do n't like racing games the producers should have tried a little harder on this game i was completly unsatified
i use to love this game and after purchasing this one i found i still do the game was of quality and is still working just fine
mario kart 64 launched with the n64 and it sure did good with the sales but ultimatley this is disapointing   mario kart succeds in graphics departure but fails at the boring over and over gameplay that you indure in the game   do n't get me wrong this is a great game but it just pretty much fail to fun factor   back when i got this game when it first came out i simply loved it but after the next day it kind of got boring for me   the game is great but fails with the overuse of boring driving and nothing exciting happens   if it were up to me i would have addes some really cool driving maze level(yeah it does sound lame but what ever)in graphics the game is simply superb   it really does make the n64 a really good lookin system   the level desighning and great setups make it one of the better looking n64 back in the days when it was still popular ..   it truly does make some ps games look like crap the sound is pretty average ... ehh i rather not go into that .. now ....... the gameplay .. it just get 's boring after awhile and nothing special happens and the single player is pretty short   but cool ...... and that 's pretty much it the multiplayer is pretty fun   i had a blast playing it with my friends   it really is fun but like i said before ... nothing special when it all comes down to this   the boring yet kind of fun gameplay great graphics but does n't help gameplay really fun mp but still fails to succeed in fun factor(well atleast to me)i give mario kart 64 a 3.4 stars out of 5lates ..
mario kart 64 is the true 3d nintendo 64 sequel to super mario kart since the characters would n't look so great on karts in 3d on the n64 the sprites are in 2d which explains how they are fully detailed there are 16 courses you can race in along with 4 courses for your average battle mode now that there are 4 players the 2 4 player modes can be pretty fun especially 2-player since it has all the options from 1-player mode the item roster is slightly different from super mario kart but it 's fun to use them all overall mario kart 64 is another game that defines 3d gaming on the nintendo 64
i love this game this is the coolest game ever brings back great memories from my childhood playing this game it never gets old to play
i have the wii version and is horrible just like you hit an opponent with a shell pass and with no item the cpu boosts way ahaed horrible
mario kart64 is one of the more entertaining video games of all times it is suitable for all ages and can be enjoyed and mastered by the young and old 4-player simultaneous play with a selection of 8 classic mario characters and 4 different difficulties beat all curcuits in 3rd or better to earn extra mode and 16 levels of play each level containing it 's own unique obstacles and course
this game is pretty darn easy   i beat most of the tracks with only a rental   it 's not near as tough as the snes version   heck the snes version of rainbow road had no walls around the track and the track was thin to boot   rainbow road is a cakewalk on this one   wide the whole way with walls all around   too darn easy   however there is a monster shortcut that 's very dangerous to go for if you want to make things interesting even though it was too easy i bought the game anyway   it 's fun to beat the heck out of these computer controlled suckers   plus i really like the game 's ending there is one hard level the one with all of the traffic in the extra mode   it can be very frustrating if you make a mistake because you get run over again and again and again   it usually takes away any hope of recovery the most significant improvement over the snes version is the time trial mode   you can race a ghost of yourself after you 've already completed the course   the ghost is only a recording of your previous performance but it gives you a lot more motivation to beat your old time i assure you i've never been into multiplayer modes but if you 're into that kind of thing you 'll really love this game   some multiplayer matches can go on for a long time since the levels are so well designed
when i first heard of a mario kart game comming out for nintendo 64 i was overjoyed to realize that they would keep up on such an awesome super   nintendo game   to my amazment the game came to the 64 with nothing but   crisp graphics and pre rendered characters abound   however where there   comes the good side of all this there is a bad side some of the   characters in the game in fact cheat to win   now i 'm not sure why this   little feature was allowed perhaps to make it more challenging or give us   more reason to throw the controller at the wall when mario suddenly jumps   out in front of you   however you can master there cheating ways by   learning how to outwit them at their own game   find shortcuts and other   things that can aid you in your race for the finish   from cheating to   graphics and music i must say that the graphics are quite impressive for   such a game made so early on   the music is also amazing with hummable   tunes that will get you in the mood to race or the mood to hit wario off   the side of a moutain just to here him scream   the sure thing to do now is   to buy the game because it is a classic and always will be
anyone who owns a nintendo 64 and does not own mario kart should just throw it away this is a classic n64 game that 's a ton of funeven today where there are games with better graphics the point of the game is simple win the race by any means there are no plot twists no complicated storylines it has all the classic mario characters includingmario luigi peach bowser wario toad yoshi and others once you finish everything there is a bonus optionwhere you can play all levels again but backwards!seriously this game is an awesome classicand a great addition to any and all n64 game collections overall,5/5
this has to be one of the best multiplayer games created for the nintendo 64 this kind of game is great for all ages i 'm 18 years old and my friends and i still to this day continue to play mario kart it is a perfect racing game that has great sound effects and can keep you entertained for hours you can play it by yourself but to get the true experience of this game its best to play it with others there is really no story line to the game just a bunch of maps and characters to choose to race with if you get bored of racing over and over again there are several mini games known as battle games to choose from honestly i like playing the battle games more than i like racing because its fun to take down your friends and family so overall i would definitely say get this game if you do n't have it it is a must buy for avid nintendo 64 users
this game is defanitly worth the time and money.( ... )you can choose from either mario grand prix vs.,battle or time trial in mario grand prix you choose from a wide selection of characters wich one you want to be you can pick from four different cups each with four different race tracks then it 's time to race as you play against the 7 other characters up to 4 people can play mario grand prix in vs.,you play against one computer character or 2 family members or friends you can choose any course is the game up to 3 can play vs.in the battle mode up to four can play you get 3 balloons and the other player(s try to pop them the last one standing wins up to 4 can play battle mode finally in time trial only one person plays you can choose any course you try to make a good time and if you want you can try to beat it only one player can do time trial mario kart is a great game and if you have a n64,get it
this is one of the best star wars n64 games they have made i say if you have a n64 get this game need i say more
i was never a really big fan of sci fi and star wars just was n't my thing i could n't really care less about those darned rebels obviously my expectations for rogue squadron that summer day were not very high but you know what i played the first mission and i was pleasantly surprised the game actually was n't that bad   it was actually quite entertaining just flying around and shooting these drones out from the sky the game really is n't that easy to learn especially if you buy the game used without an instruction booklet there are basically a lot of nooks and crannies that i have yet to figure out like what right c does or how bombs work but the introductory missions are fun and pretty easy however the gameplay got to be quite repetitive i mean you just go around and shoot enemies from the sky yay there are also a lot of sections where you have nothing to do and it gets boring maybe i could have moved on to the third mission i also realized how visually stunning the game is i have an expansion pak so i really do n't have a clue what the game would be like without it but the graphics are just so crisp at least certain features the buildings and structures and ships and stuff look great almost to the level of half life but the graphics for the people storm troopers leave more to be desired they are obviously sprites the music does have a star wars feel to it and that 's growing on me i sometimes get certain tunes stuck in my head and i do n't mind most of the music is in the menus though 40 minutes of speech is nice if only i could understand half of it rogue squadron has no multiplayer which is too bad it would have been fun oh well overall i actually kind of enjoyed this game
rogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat the 3d enviroment is cool looking and on some levels there are places you can see that are straight out of the movie such as jabba the hutt 's palace on tattoine the main problem i have with this game is on the hoth and deathstar mission.(use password deaddack to get to them)on the hoth mission you wrap a cord around imperial walkers to trip them which is tricky to do as for the deathstar mission the scenery is wrong in the movie luke fires at the exhaust port at the end of the trench in the game the target is on the ground but that 's not what bothers me most though after you hit your target it just says mission complete they should 've had a cinematic sequence where the deathstar blows up that does n't happen in the game which leaves you feeling angry and unsatisfied
i picked this up in a pack of two other n64 games for five dollars at a used game store now usually those bundle deals have all of the mediocre n64 games in them that no one wants to buy individually however star wars rogue squadron is easily one of the best n64 games i 've ever played story the game appears to take place between a new hope and the empire strikes back in the star wars universe you 're luke skywalker the original trilogy 's protagonist and a fighter pilot for the rebel alliance you 'll help people with vital intelligence defect from the empire protect rebel allied cities and of course fight the empire!gameplay unfortunately you never get to wield a light saber or anything that 's not what this game is about it 's a space shooter you travel to different planets in your x wing or   one of the other rebel spaceships and do missions sound there may be an n64 game with more audio than rogue squadron but i 've never played it if so and i 've played entirely too many of them p there 's so much voice acting there 's lengthy descriptions of every ship in the rebel fleet backstories for rogue squadron 's fighter pilots and of course in level communication between the pilots graphics it 's a very nice job by factor 5 here of course it looks dated by now but in the grand scheme of things i 'd say it 's aged pretty gracefully make sure you have an expansion pack for your system to get the full effect replay value you get medals for doing well enough in every stage i 'm told that if you get medals in every stage you can unlock secret missions like the battle of hoth from empire strikes back and the death star run if that 's not incentive to beat this game 100 what is?it 's clearly a classic n64 game worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as goldeneye64 and ocarina of time i 'd only that having a decent n64 analog helps .. a lot if your controller 's analog is dying due to wear and tear you 'll have a hard time towards the end of the game
i have got to be honest even if it means sacking my reputation i have never played a game so much before in my life i only own the n64 still for this game i have thrown out all others this game brings such a movie like experience along with great missions craft and imperial action that i have never seen anything to its likeness you have got to get this game under all circumstances if you are a star wars fan
originally playing rogue leader star wars rogue squadron 2 it 's great to get back to the keystone that started the whole franchise while not allowing for some of the more advanced gameplay from future games this product is and was fantastic for the age of n64 era gaming a much needed classic to add to the collection for sure
there have been many n64 games to brighten up the new generation of gaming   this game not only has sharp graphics but it also has great gameplay and is very challenging
for the n64 this game is really fun graphics are amazing sound quality is alright if you love flight simulation games then this is definitely for you you are luke skywalker flying around on various fun missions there are tons of unlockable cheats that can be added for a better fun filled experience get the expansion pack-- which is cheap nowadays
this has to be one of the best star wars games ever made it 's on par with jedi knight dark forces 2 and knights of the old republic it 's one of the first games to nail the dog fights from the 1st star wars films the controls are great and it 's easy to get used to it shows off planets that are both new and familer from the films like hoth if your a star wars nut like me get it
well i 'm going to have to agree with darth vader on the strong part but as for the force part i 'm nonchalant star wars rogue squadron begins somewhere in between star wars episode iv and episode vi let me just say you 'll be visiting place in the star wars universe and doing missions that have no bearings to the movies which is good with me the graphics in the game are some of the best you 'll ever see on the n64 the music and the atmosophere of the game are very well done this is i would say the best star wars rogue squadron game ever made oh and by the way yes i have played star wars rogue squadron rogue leader i fully recommend this game and that s my review remember be a customer not a consumer period"- jake smithers
this game is great for star wars fans there are eleven single missions but there are three bonus missions too the first is a race on tatooine where you fly a t-16 skyhopper in a race against three of your squadron mates the second is the death star trench run which the developers in my opinion over did because the trence is huge and it has to many turns the best bonus level is the battle of hoth the graphics and music are superd just like every other lucasarts and factor five 5 game their are also secret vehicles you can pilot the naboo starfighter by using a secret code go to lucasarts website the millunium falcon and the tie interceptor can be earned when you complete the game by getting all the gold medals it does n't take long to beat this game if your good at games like this but ot does offer a pretty good challenge now go join the rebellion and vaporize those tie fighters
thank you for this game my nephews keep playing this game they say that it is so much fun they keep fighting to see who is going to win the game thank you so much
rogue squadron   every star wars fan knows the elite starfighter group of pilots   now you get the opportunity to experience what it feels like to hop into the cockpit of an x wing y wing a wing v wing millenium falcon t.i.e. interceptor and the naboo starfighter   as you fly through over 15 missions ranging from tatooine to mon calamari you 'll earn ranks in the squardron&lt;the highest i 've gotten is gold leader&gt   with each mission you complete you 'll earn a medal&lt;bronze silver or gold&gt;and be promoted   do you have what it takes to buy this game and prove you 've got what it takes to be a top fighter pilot
okay i normally love everything lucas arts puts out but this ... i really honestly loathed this game the gameplay was repetitive hard and booring basically it is every vehicular battle from the trilogy put on a game while this had great potential and awesome graphics i can not reccomend it
star wars rogue squadron is hands down the best n64 game ever made get this game even if you 're not a star wars fan you wo nt regret it
i loved this game when i first played it i still play it even today the graphics where awsome the sound was cool the levels where all kinds of stratageys and the expansion pack worked great with it the cheats to fly the falcon tie fighters naboo fighter ect all made the game even better there is even a secret little mini game where you can control a chicken walker at st and shoot up some droids and buildings in a small space the only downfall is there is no way to get unlimited heat seeker rockets so you have to turn on your unlimited lives cheat and keep commiting suicide to get more of those rockets to win within the selected times to get the gold medal to become a jedi and there is no nice video 's to watch when you finally clock the game it just shows a quick shot of the ships flying away and then the credits roll ... it would be nice to have had a video type of thing like all through the game apart from that this game rocked .. my the shwartz be with you
when the n64 system first kicked off one of its first titles was star wars shadows of the empire   shadows ... was a very entertaining version of novel it was based on   it had challenging yet rewarding levels and overall solid gameplay   however it had two marks against it   the first was that graphics had not fully realized the potential of the n64 and resembled supernes games on certain boards   the second is that except for the sheer enjoyment of the playing the game again shadows ... lacks any real replay value   the introduction of star wars rogue squadron based on a series of very successful novels to the n64 environment corrected these problems and set a whole new standard for action adventure games on any platform "rogue squadron focuses on the missions of the famed rogue squadron thought to be the most dangerous and lethal fighter pilot unit in the entire galaxy   led by the legendary wedge antilles the squadron fights 16 regular missions and 3 bonus missions ranging from defending the homestead on the deserts of tatooine to rescuing prisoners from the spice mines of kessel to battling the terrifying world devastators on mon calamari   that just barely scratches the surface of the exotic locales where missions take place   the graphic environment is much more advanced this time around   no more static matte backgrounds   everything is fluid and moves with the player   the gameplay has also been enhanced   greater control is afforded to the joystick button on the control pad when it comes to manipulating the ships   overall it makes for a spectacular gaming experience "rogue squadron also adds a new twist that dramatically enhances its replay ability   it awards medals bronze silver gold for defeating a level with increasing degrees of efficiency   achieving all of a certain kind of medal on all the regular missions also unlocks bonus missions   this creates a greater challenge and a greater sense of accomplishment once the challenge has been met there is only one minor quibble about rogue squadron   in the game designers quest to make a very demanding game they make some of the levels almost too hard to defeat even with the highest level of skill   the most glaring example of this is the level raid on sullust   flying as a supposedly heavily armored y wing one is supposed to be able to fly skillfully and defeat the mission   however the board is heavily populated with missile turrets that defend each of the 12 15 targets that must be hit   with skillful flying it may be possible to knockout 3 or 4 of those targets and corresponding guns and turrets before dying but on the life it 's likely the next ship could be destroyed in less than 10 seconds   with only 3 ships per mission it 's impossible to defeat that mission without using the unlimited lives cheat code which will not be revealed here   however there 's no shame in using that code and it is necessary if one intends to achieve the silver or gold medals   so it 's a minor annoyance "rogue squadron raised the bar to an exceptionally high level for action adventure games that other platforms have repeatedly shown a failure to meet   nintendo still gets it though as it followed this game with the even more successful rogue leader for gamecube   rogue squadron is a must have for any serious gamer 's library
if i had to pick one word to describe this game it would be amazing   quot;rogue squadron&quot pushes the n64 to it 's maximum power graphically which can be further enhanced by an expansion pack i strongly recommend going with one it makes the game run smoother   the gameplay could n't be more entertaining i often wonder how my little nintendo 64 is able to handle all that this game has to offer   the missions you fly in this game vary from escorting ground troops into combat all the way to launching full foward attacks on monstrous imperial ships   the ai is pretty strong depending on the difficulty level but when it comes to your own wingmen helping you out just forget it   environments in this game are incredible for a nintendo 64 game and i give the designers alot of credit for putting so much work into them   ca n't get you 're hands on the new rogue squadron quot;rogue leader&quot for gamecube pick this up to satisfy you re urge if you do own rogue leader or even do n't plan on getting it pick this title up anyways for a hell of a gaming experience
lucasarts has really outdone itself with this great n64 game   after shadows of the empire was released it quickly became obvious that the best level in the game was the first level where you are flying a rebel airspeeder during the battle of hoth   la decided to make a whole game using a similar concept and rogue squadron was born   you play as luke skywalker leader of rogue squadron a group of elite rebel pilots who roam the galaxy making life difficult for the empire and its minions   you play through 16 basic missions which together form a loose plot chronicling the adventures of rogue squadron during the time between the destruction of the first death star and the empire strikes back   the missions range from simple search and destroy missions to escorting supply trains to freeing rebel soldiers from imperial prison facilities   along the way you must learn to handle a variety of rebel craft from the x wing to the airspeeder   each craft has its own strengths and weaknesses plus each craft has a special weapon which means that you are required to use each craft on certain missions   after you complete each mission you may be awarded a bronze silver or gold medal based on your performance   after completing a mission you can move on to the next one or else go back and try again to get a better score   the game gives you a score summary after each mission so you know right away which areaas you need to improve upon to get the gold the look and feel of the game is excellent   the graphics are superb and the expansion pak boosts them to cinematic levels   the sound is also excellent for a non cd game although the chatter from your squadron mates does get a little repetitive   the game is contained within a 3d environment giving the game a flight simulator like feel   the controls are pretty easy to get used to though this does take a little practice   fortunately the first couple of missions are pretty easy so you get a good chance to get familiar with the controls   the controls are the same for each ship so you do n't have to switch back and forth as stated before the first couple of missions are pretty simple and easy   but starting with about the fourth mission they start to get really tough with multitudes of tie fighters missile turrets and gun emplacements all doing their best to shoot you down   expect to die many times before mastering each mission   getting the gold medal on all 16 missions will definitely take a while the game has a lot of nice bonus features as well   as you complete missions and earn higher medals three bonus missions will appear plus you will gain access to new ships including the millenium falcon and a captured imperial tie interceptor   there is also a passcode screen allowing you to enter codes to unlock all sorts of interesting options including a fourth bonus level and the naboo starfighter   there is even a code to allow you to fly a buick sedan against the empire   the codes themselves are pretty easy to get   there are several sites on the internet that have them it 's easy to get immersed in the 3d environment of this game   many 's the time i 've found myself leaning over to the left or right as i put my x wing through a tight turn   for those who like flight simulator type games i would say that this is the best fs game on the n64   it 's a bit dated now what with the impending release of rogue squadron ii for the gamecube but for those n64 fans out there this one is a must have
do not get me wrong   i am one of the biggest zelda fans in the world and i bought this one as soon as it came out with the gold cartige and   all but this just is n't a zelda game .... its missing the fancy tunes   the story just does n't seem that addictive when you first get the game   its great and it looks to be one of the best games but then after you beat   it .... its kinda boring ... zelda games should never get boring zelda nes   i still paly that damn game link not as good as the first but still i   like playing it zelda a link to the pass on snes is the best zelda game i just can not love this game .. it did horrorble for a zelda game
ocarina of time is the best video game of the last 100 years if you have never played it your missing out plus you are a tool
the first zelda game for the 64 the legend of zelda ocarina of time won game of the year for 1999   as link your quest to save the tri force from the evil ganondorf will take you all over hyrule not only in the present but also the future with the help of the ocarina of time   if you like the zelda series this game is definently for you or even if you just like to save the world in your spare time
i love this game   i love this game   i love this game   i just got ocarina of time and it 's been a few years since it has come out it still rocks even in comparison to what 's out now   i 've had a playstation 2 for a couple of years and have had a good game here and there but after playing ocarina of time i realize that i had forgotten the beauty of nintendo games   they just have a special feel to them and they make me remember the years that i was a little tike playing old nintendo games   i just beat the game about 5 minutes ago   i certainly wo n't spoil anything but i will tell you that the ending is over 30 seconds long and is something worth playing through the game to see ...   a video game has n't brought me this level of satisfaction in a while   bravo nintendo bravo
i just bought this game a few weeks ago and it 's awesome it just has that this is going to be an epic game from the get go it has great graphics even to this day first of all this is an action adventure not a rpg role playing game next i recommend buying the strategy guide this game is what gamers call nintendo hard it 's a challenging game with quite a number of puzzle parts anyway buy it if you have a 64,or virtual console it if you have a wii
this game is blew me away i did n't expect ocarina to meet with my standards after playing the previous zelda games   they usually go stale and predictable but ocarina did n't do that   it 's a game for true fans of the adventure genre   the dungeons are long and perilous there are numerous side quests a great cast of characters and a large world to travel   if you have any doubts about this game eliminate them   you wo n't be dissapointed
this could be the best game of all time what else needs to be said if you have n't played this game before and still have a working n64 you need to pickup this game if you have n't played the game you can also find it on the wii virtual console and an upcoming remake for 3ds
i 'm what gamers call a zelda veteran i 've played almost all of the zelda games and managed to beat only one this one   i love the zelda games because they are challenging different and fun to play in this one link lives in a forest with the forest folk   link is soon inside the deku tree to defeat the evil monsters that moved into the tree   after a battle with the queen spider the deku tree sadly dies and tells link to find zelda the princess of hyrule hyrule is a kingdom that 's always in trouble and its up to link to save the land from a terrible enemy   link has the help of navi a fairy that gives you advice or tells you what you should do next during his adventures link will learn spells be swallowed by a huge fish and saving the land from the evil ganondorf   this game is a classic and worth the money
for all those of you that have followed the lineage of zelda from its early days on the classic 8-bit system and onward to its snes days with quot;a link to the past&quot great game and loved every second of it then you have to buy this game for those of you that have never played any other zelda game what are you waiting for now is a great time to start ocarina of time is amazing all the elements of classic zelda are there dozens of powerful items and weapons lots of secrets to find at least 10 new 3d rendered challenging dungeons plenty of secrets and side games and something that all the other zelda 's never had a truly great story!if you enjoyed quot;a link to the past&quot you will most certainly like this game as well the story of ocarina of time involves going back and forth in time between a happy peaceful hyrule and a dark evil one much like alttp but do n't think this is a rip off on its predecessor the complex dungeons challenging bosses and deepening story lines will blow you away the 3d element of the game also adds so much more that was never possible before even the music is catchy and well orchestrated i actually downloaded the mp3 soundtrack online!)the gameplay is a little tough to get used to afterall you 've never played zelda in 3d before so you actually have to consider things sneaking up behind you and flying overhead but once you get used to the controls and learn to use the quot;z targeting&quot feature using the trigger button will solve just about any control problem you may encounter the gameplay gets easier the only thing that annoyed me was navi a little fairy that travels with link throughout the game she is always bugging you to give you painfully obvious information i suppose she is a helpful guide for younger or more inexperienced players but i found her annoying but once you come to realize that navi is an important aspect of the game 's control you will let it slide i would recommend this game to anyone who owns an n64 console and even more so if you enjoyed snes 's quot;a link to the past.&quot i ca n't wait to play the sequel when it comes out
really though could an old out dated game still be awesome 4 years later   the answer is yes because this game is just too good   it gives you a complete story on hyrule and the triforce not to mention the best video game music ever especially the boss music   being able to play as young link and adult link in two similar yet in a way completely different worlds as one would find out sooner or later   the graphics are still and when this was released it was the best game graphicwise as well   the bosses are easy yet in a way challenging and the dungeons and temples are amazingly designed   however there are two faults one minor one somewhat major.-link is missing the strap on his frontside that holds his sword case thingy   well it just kinda looks odd.-the quot;final boss&quot is far too easy ... but do n't be too sure of that ...
i 'm not really a fan of n64   i 've always been more of a playstation one fanatic but zelda is undoubtedly the best game that i have ever played   if you think that final fantasy is good then zelda will make all of the installments in final fantasy look like junk   there 's only a couple of games on the nintendo n64 console that of which i liked and that was gauntlet legends super mario and donkey kong   but this game beats them all by a longshot then why did i give this game four stars instead of five   the reason is because of the ... problems listed below.1   this game is hard i do n't mean hard as in challenging i 'm talkin about the whole you possibly will never ever complete the game without a strategy guide hard   the type of frustration which can rack your nerves big time.2   there are a couple of glitches in the game example i dare you to cut a sign with your sword   then play zeldas lullaby with your ocerina of time   the piece of sign which you had just sliced and diced will float   that 's just one of the glitches.3   a little confusing as far as the story goes   it 's better to play the game twice and see if you still understand it.4   replay value is n't very high   once you complete it that 's it   it 's so hard that i would n't ever want to go through the same frustration again as to the fact that it was very difficult even if you do know what you 're doing okay those were the bads   here are the goods.1   the graphics are outstanding   wow   the whole world of termina reminds me of middle earth only a lot less dark and ten times more exotic.2   once you beat the game you feel satisfied with yourself   sure this game is a little short but it will still take you a long time to beat it no matter how experienced you are with gaming.3 the plot is good and twists a lot   i know that i said it was kind of confusing and it kind of is but it 's still fun and the things that of which i did understood surprised me a lot it 's sort of a mystery.4   fluint and absolutely excellent cut and fmw sequences   it 's true   like i said above the graphics are wonderful   and plus exploring a small portion of termina which you do through out the game is an experience that you do n't wanna miss.5   the bad guys are challenging but not so challenging that you 'll be ripping your hair out   once you beat them you feel satisfied.6   highly addictive gameplay and plus you wo n't stop until you beat the game but there 's one major and i mean major problem with this game   this game is so addictiive that you might forget about everything else in life   remember your family   you wo n't when you get this game since you'l be wanting to play this game even more a anyways get the game
before i played this game the only other zelda game that i had ever played was link to the past and i could n't understand it that well   i decided to play this because of the hype   i was sure glad i did   this is one of the best games ever   it 's full of adventure it has a wonderful story and it is challenging   it begins with link a 10-year old kokiri child of the forest who is chosen to save hyrule his home world   along the way you meet new friends such as princess zelda and grow into a 17-year old adult to fight the evil ganondorf   you have many different weapons spells and items at your disposal including swords bows and a giant hammer   the fun never stops and the story never goes flat   if you want a grand adventure buy this game   if you like this play the legend of zelda majora 's mask but wait until you finish this game
very fun game to play and has an excellent story line to play lots of different equipment to use and the game is n't overly difficult to beat
i 'll make it short ... i hope i'm not particular a fantasy lover i never read tolkien 's lord of the ring i hate the lord of the ring movies and was insulted by the numerous oscars the film(s received i despise the star wars movies especially the return of the jedi which has that peculiar fantasy feel in it blahdieblahblah now with games it 's a different story i do n't know why but i 'm much more forgiving and willing to accept a world where fairies gnomes and other creatures excist the ocarina of time is one of few artistic highlights i encountered in my life ... it 's almost ridiculous when i think about what i 've just wrote what about literature art and cinema?this game moved me so much ... am i a geek? ... there 's so much depth in this piece of ... art it is n't the story alone c'mon let 's be honest it 's an average fantasy tale if made into a movie i 'd fall asleep after 10 minutes i think it 's all the pieces put together a beautiful crafted world the progress when playing from a child into a young man the challenges you 'll face and overcome the music that playes a big role in the game the use of time day and night future and past etc etc it grabs you and most important it 's interactive duh for it 's a game you 're not watching a crap fantasy movie but playing the hero all by yourself when he looses you loose etc i played a lot of games in my life including many new(er titles as halo gta metroid prime etc etc and i did n't yet played a game that matched the sheer brilliance of the legend of zelda the ocarina of time best game ever so far
i was worried about getting this but i did anyways because i have been after it for a long time i was worried because it was used acceptable but it has played great so far though i have n't gotten very far yet so so far i am so glad i went ahead and ordered it
i have played all the other zelda series games and this is the best   i first heard of this game when i borrowed it from a friend   i played it nonstop until i beat the game   the only hard part about it is the dreaded water temple   it is the only actual hard one but do n't get me wrong the rest of the dungeons are equally difficult   even the first level is as difficult because you have only your sword shield and wits   but as you progress you gain pieces of hearts weapons swords shields and other tools   the graphics are really cool the sound could be just a tad better and the fun is the best   the only bad part is you ca n't unfreeze zora 's domain and get the triforce or miyamoto says   well if you liked the other zelda games this is a must have   if you never have played a zelda game get a life
i was always a fan of zelda when it first came out for the original nintendo   this is a fairly challenging game and i got bored with it quickly   there is n't a lot of violence in this game but i think it 's too advanced for kids to play
quite possibly if you do n't know why then you have n't played many videogames ;-)
every once in a while i experience a piece of entertainment that is so overrated it 's hard to believe i 'm even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best the legend of zelda ocarina of time is that very piece of overrated entertainment talk about a video game that not only does n't live up to the hype not even close but it does n't do a darn thing to impress me even if i were to ignore all the exaggerated hype this is a serious letdown of a video game but again please understand i 'm not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game i care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else apparently most zelda fans believe puzzle based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the zelda series one thing that positively stinks is that the land of hyrule despite being presented as beautiful and realistic- do n't tell me nintendo was n't riding the 3d high in 1998 and going for realism here it 's basically a gigantic piece of nothingness simply a means of getting from one area to another a large colorless empty field that link either runs or rides his horse across nothing magical medieval or interesting about any of this it feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house going into this game after a link to the past you 'll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles remember all those trees rocks grass and water sections from link to the past remember how rich and vibrant they looked ha nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld oh sure the monsters come out at night in predictable spots but that 's it as far as i can see only one monster actually comes out named stalchild terribly lacking the trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too the dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it 's almost unfathomable to believe nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient again where are all the enemies why am i roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like i 'm really inside a castle now give me a break guys the rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner these castles are alarmingly empty lifeless and unacceptable but ... that 's apparently okay because ocarina of time is the first 3d zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels right not in my world baby the games following ocarina of time perfected the zelda formula way more effectively wind waker and skyward sword leaves this dated mess in the dust while normally i do n't care about graphics in a video game you got ta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the zelda series more engrossing this is just ... gross only the realistic looking flawed overworld is a sight to behold which of course now looks significantly better in twilight princess clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons is n't much to admire i do n't really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings trees or other objects that are all part of the nintendo 64 's datedness sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or at the very least forgiving what i do mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction or having a game entirely too long so we 're forced to persevere these issues time and time again in other words i 'd be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy uninspiring graphics in other areas sadly it does n't this is n't even much of an issue compared to the other complaints i have which i 'll mention below- keep reading these graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of mega men legends and the walls of the quake series the graphics in link to the past are unique and can not be compared to any other game let 's discuss the dungeons shall we despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it 's almost a chore going through one generic room after another ocarina of time shows the makings of early 3d development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead when you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you 're doing and where you 're going it 's enough to make you think you 're playing with string puppets again early 3d design flaws and datedness the storytelling is really basic and predictable it 's never elaborate like in wind waker or skyward sword it 's mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called goron 's for the first half and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half this is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented it does n't even feel or look like you 're going 7 years into the future as link 's appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he does n't appear to be much different from his younger self oh sure he 's slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it 's very subtle the music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however all the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments but melodic and memorable several dungeon themes are well made and believably chilling and haunting the right ingredients were definitely put into the music making aspect of the game the hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and wo n't get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there the dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate pushing to open up portals or switches or hopelessly generic i 'm stuck in a maze and i ca n't get out frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3d game design but ... these are n't any ordinary mazes these are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn hence the flawed early 3d game design a cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be or in other words needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2d zelda 's so memorable sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch open a door collecting these silver rupees is way too similar to super mario 64 with the red coins the lost woods is a tunnel infested maze with no personality whatsoever the lost woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration the enemies or rather what little enemies you will stumble upon on your adventure through the temples is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game these dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable you will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy why even have a sword in the 2d games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and guess what now the dungeons are exciting a genius idea really here in ocarina of time it 's all about atmosphere it 's all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once nintendo 's most recent creation back in 1998 but ... nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day what was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable that 's exactly what has happened with ocarina of time- it has n't stood the test of time do you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a zelda game seriously their animations are so stiff due to the nintendo 64 's limitations as a console that it 's unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards link but even then most dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable big skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it 's more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you 're running around the spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting somehow all the enemies manage to never once be memorable ever ocarina of time has dated horrendously seriously wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make red bubble is basically the same thing as big skulltula but on fire and gibdos are boring the redead 's let out a hilarious scream that freezes link in place which is inconvenient when you 're trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you 're stuck in a room with two of them mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them run behind them and slice them with your sword to be fair some enemies are cool such as deku baba where it 's best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there the deku scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat and the lizalfos and dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies the game overall has a shortage of rupees they 're really not that important which is odd this is the first zelda game i 've ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought not something to take real seriously if you do n't feel like collecting them then don't- no harm done the bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon you have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform it takes forever and no this boss is nowhere as fun as the water dungeon in link to the past in case you 're wondering the hookshot is used more than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often the hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas after you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens you get a beneficial reward you can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy usually found on walls i admit i love the witches you face in the spirit temple while the temple itself is really short and boring it 's probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight you have to use your shield to reflect shots at the other witch and it 's really fun and creative the hookshot 's basically a required item to properly deal with hard shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it 's annoying that it 's used way more frequently than the sword throughout the game due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while especially if you keep missing your target and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot if you have n't noticed yet the water dungeon in ocarina of time is just abominable i bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way also the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons mostly for warping from one place to another nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina way too many darn times it 's overdone just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake do n't make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times if not more i never really counted how many times i used it it was a lot it severely drags the gameplay atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina watching link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing i 've ever seen no wonder people think nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days this game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence ganon 's castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful it 's supposed to be filled with dangerous traps tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place but ... the one in ocarina of time falls way short of being presentable by normal legend of zelda standards instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier the problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees this is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening another bonus point for link to the past oh and the ganon fight his strategy is stolen from agahnim 's battle from link to the past but takes several more minutes to bring down remember how you fought agahnim yup same exact strategy but in a 3d world sigh the second part of the ganon fight after a looooong and tedious time based departure from the top of a castle is to shoot arrows at ganon and hit his glowing behind several times it 's really easy all of it however fighting him in one of the early dungeons forest temple is actually one of the most memorable in the entire zelda series this is because ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a very unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept reminds me of a harry potter movie a few other complaints fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy it 's better than most fishing games i 've played in other games i admit expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them that 's a rare compliment i can give some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun i do n't really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm if you fall behind even a little bit you 'll lose performing this same ghost chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you 're dodging fireballs the other task earlier on in the game in the ice cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle based having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15 20 times this particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting basically when compared to the 2d games ocarina of time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the zelda series into 3d but only giving us a small portion of what 's available in link to the past as a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions it 's because the nintendo 64 is a limited console that 's really only able to handle so much ocarina of time comes up way short even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going avoiding being detected by guards is n't fun after the first time oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a metal gear solid stealth style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people the stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters these red sword swinging enemies appear on screen the same exact enemy 4 times in a row with no differences between any of them at first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times and they fall over and die reading text and having boring discussions with zelda trees and other semi interesting characters does n't get the job done either ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual that one conversation with zelda and link with ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in hyrule castle comes to mind here i will admit that some of the flame covered cutscenes involving ganon riding his horse is very intimidating the cutscene outside the bridge of hyrule castle comes to mind here otherwise ganon 's presented uninterestingly you 're supposed to get a feeling of hopelessness that ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but ... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems ganon being a ruthless villain does n't ever materialize at least he 's not as scary as he should be).recognize ocarina of time for making the 3d zelda series exist that 's fair it allowed wind waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3d zelda formula better starting from that game until now by 2003 nintendo was working with the technologically superior gamecube console which allowed the zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories gameplay graphics replay value and excitement i say avoid ocarina of time but hey nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful day
in its tenure the n64 had its share of bad games with exceptions like super mario 64 the thq wrestling games and a few others it seemed like the bad outweighed the good but with ocarina of time the balance took a drastic shift as n64 was given its best overall game 'ocarina of time has many strong points for itself for one the player is given a very challenging and extremely satisfying quest to undertake the game plays across a vast world with different subsections each with their own particular themes the gameplay is easy to get used to and becomes second nature as you play through the game graphics and sounds are done extremely well considering the cartridge space allowed there is not much to complain about as this game really showed players what the n64 was capable of it 's unfortunate that other game publishers did n't work this hard but then again quot;ocarina&quot is a tough act to follow
this is one of the best and my personal favorites from the zelda franchise the story was fantastic the gameplay was amazing for the time even compared to todays gaming this game showed less problems or glitches there was hardly any serious problems with this game the playtime was a very good length and it offered a some side quests to do each dungeon was well constructed and were not something you walk in and leave unhappy some parts were frustrating sure but when is a game just so easy and you feel happy beating it?puzzles in this game were i suppose challenging for   child but they were not impossible this is a great game for all ages and a great buy as well
this game is defently one of my top favorite games i do nt have it but i 've rented it and it is cool your constantly under presure and near the end it feels like there s no where to go in this game you shoot arrows fight theifs get a horse venture in caves and much more challenges like deafeating the power hungry sorcerer gannondorf deffently 5 stars i m planing on buying this game today
this zelda game is simply amazing the wind waker sucked and four swords was ok but this game rocks the main plot was spectacular and the gameplay was great i first played the game after getting collector 's edition for christmas and i was addicted to it the main plot throughout the whole game is that link(as a kid must collect 3 spiritual stones and open the door of time along with the ocarina of time as an adult link must awaken the 5 sages and fight to destroy the evil ganondorf and rescue zelda i have beaten the game 6 times it was so good i highly recommend it to big zelda fans note this game has a sequel called majora 's mask but it 's not near as good in my opinion
seriously this ranks up with some of the worst games i have ever played it is a complete insult to anyone who respects the rpg genre as this is nothing more than a linear cutesy puzzle game you run around playing a little harmonica by pressing certain buttons in certain orders and the rest of the time you are moving boxes around jumping from platform to platform and killing enemies with an awful targeting system that respawn as soon as you leave the room i can guarantee that about 95 of all the 4 and 5 star votes are coming from children under the age of 15 as this is the type of game that would appeal to them but if you are an older more experienced gamer do yourself a favor and steer clear from this hideous example of a good title gone bad if you 'll excuse me i am going to balance out my wobbly kitcken table with the cartridge
what else is there to say this is the best game i have every played totally worth a replay the game was in great condition and got to me quickly
the best n64 game it 's easy difficult to totally master and is fun to play again and again the bosses are creative and original and the dungeons are fun and easy storyline is pretty good better than the quot;save the princess&quot generalization it 's often given the characters are a quiet hero of time an eternally youthful forest girl a wild rock man from the firey death mountain a rebellious fish woman a determined royal guard a sexy thief the quot;princess&quot and of coure ganon the bad guy
love this game although the graphics are n't the best since it 's n64 and earlier on .... i enjoy everything about it still keeping in mind the limitations of the time such as the invisible walls and oddly prism shaped bottles etc the story is well done and unlike other zelda games all of the items are used there were some early on copies with a song chanting in the fire temple that got taken out in later copies because some people got offended by that and the mirror shield i have one such copy but even with that in mind it 's still an amazing game with great music and it sort of ties all of the zelda games together like a central hub it all comes down to this game .... definitely worth your time to play
what can i possibly say about this game that has n't been said a million times perfection groundbreaking beautiful just some of the words that come to mind when i think of zelda 64.zelda was my introduction to rpg 's and what an introduction it was the good everything graphics story pacing etc ... insanely difficult in parts i still ca n't beat the water temple without the walk through and ganon in the painting still has to be one of the coolest boss battles of all time the bad?nothing one of the games that not only defined the n64 but a game that set the standard for excellence in rpg's one of the best ... ever highest recommendations
what can i say about this game i bought it to replace one that was stolen when i was a kid it 's great to hear those classic sound effects and that legendary music epic
this game is the best game on my n64 next to nightmare creatures this game feels like final fantasy with kingdom hearts it was the best selling game on the n64 if you still have one you should pick this one up
it 's ocarina of time i just wanted to get it for my fiancee for christmas because she loves the game
what can be said about ocarina of time i still remember that commercial from the late 90s it told us that a dark time is approaching my interest was piqued then i realized it was a zelda game as a huge fan of a link to the past i thought zomg that looks awesome i need to get this more than i 've ever needed to get anything i remember reading about it in gamepro and obviously being interested but that commercial sealed the deal i knew i had to have ocarina of time and that christmas my mom got it for me cheers!a lot has been said about oot over the years it has been referred to as the best game of all time by some and the most overrated game of all time by others i 'm not really in either camp but i lean closer to the former group i suppose if you have n't played it yet you should it 's out on a variety of platforms and there 's even remake of it with better graphics but i would still recommend the n64 version if you want the same experience people had back in the 90s when oot was the game you needed to play story you are link the great deku tree guardian of the forest in which you live has summoned you it 's revealed that you must visit a far off castle and meet a princess of destiny and doing so brings you square into a struggle for the fate of hyrule -- nay the world -- itself gameplay to complete your quest and save hyrule you must boldly enter into many dungeons which are filled with fierce skeletal warriors human sized spiders horrible ghosts and ... immobile venus fly traps completing a dungeon gives you an item for the main quest and completing all of the dungeons will allow you to face the final boss there 's much more to it that but i 'm trying not to spoil storyline specifics for those who have n't played it hyrule is a vast world one of your in game guides tells you that you can go wherever you want that 's true to a point there 's a lot of exploration in ocarina of time the game is always trying to point you toward a certain place but whether or not you go there is often up to you in an interactive world such as hyrule you can do many things why go see what 's on death mountain when you could pour water into all of the soil patches in hyrule or why go play the shadow temple -- which does not have any attractive gerudo women -- when you could go to the spirit temple which does the exploration is one of oot 's best features and it 's probably better than any zelda which came after it controls they work well enough you do n't have the full on camera control that some of the later zelda games give you but personally i never found it all that essential to the process ocarina of time introduced a z targeting system for aiming at enemies and talking to non playable characters what you do is get near an enemy npc press or hold z and then press a button to talk to them attack them the system pretty intuitive and well made so much so that its successors have yet to really improve upon it music:*90s gripe where is the classic zelda overworld theme oh we can hear it for like five seconds in the hyrule field theme are you serious but seriously the music is pretty good the hyrule field theme which i just mentioned is a good theme the music does a good job of fitting the areas which you visit for the most part some later zelda games use too much ambient music in the dungeons oot is guilty of this too but only to a small degree apart from the water temple 's melody there 's nothing that makes me want to relax and do some meditation or whatever while hearing it poh and i 'm sad to report that the oot commercial music is not in this game ... replay value it 's pretty massive you can do some temples in different orders than you did your first time through or you can use different items to progress through the temples i summed it up in a sentence but there 's hundreds of hours of replay potential there in just finding all of oot 's possible variations like in the original legend of zelda you can do the three heart challenge which means you can complete the game without any of the health upgrades from beating a dungeon essentially that 's playing hard mode although it is n't really that hard).but if the three heart challenge was n't enough oot lets you tack on additional stipulations to make replaying it even harder there are technically unnecessary items which let you breathe underwater and resist intense heat not getting them limits the amount of time you can spend in relevant areas on top of all that you could even as far to skip the health upgrades which halve your damage.______if you call yourself a gamer and have not played ocarina of time what are you some undercover non gamer sent in to infiltrate us go play it now
there is n't much you can say that is bad with this game for it 's time it   had excellent graphics excellent game play and sound this game is truly one in a million that i am sure any person can enjoy but if your a zelda fan and have played all if not most games from the beginning you 'll notice some of the things in oot are recycled for example the kakariko town music is completely recycled from zelda a link to the past in fact this game borrows a lot from zelda a link to the past though they do manage to change some things in oot here and there still for what it 's worth zelda oot is still a pretty darn good game though i think the story should have been more original
this is a game that is perfect it is so fun to play at times when the sun gos down u can do a lot of stuff in this game its very cool its got 20 hole hours of this game there are good ponits in this game very nice game great music better then zelda 2 for the n64 this game has much more to have even if u think u have gotton all moneys and more u have much more for this game it is a must have n64 game lovers u will want this master game for your system
was a good purchase do nt get me wrong but i had a minor problem with it saving at first it would nt save for the first 3 or 4 times but eventually it did other than that it worked great awesome condition came as described
one of the best video games ever redefined everything after it my copy came in very good condition without scratches or writing
the legend of zelda ocarina of time is the best zelda game there is you go from being a kid to being an adult link must beat five temples as an adult the forest temple the fire temple the water temple the shadow temple and the spirit temple the bosses are awsome and all the characters are cool
reading magazines from 1996 1998 one thing you could n't escape was a some kind of mention of legend of zelda ocarina of time it was all over the place popping this in my n64 when i took it home i spent literally 2 hours just exploring kokiri village just cause it was so fun but then i realized quot;oh yeah there 's more to this is n't there?&quot and that 's when the fun started graphics although you can probably debate this this has one of the best graphics you 'll find on the system lot of areas just drop that quot;wow factor&quot like when you first enter zora 's domain or the game 's many cutscenes sound although there 's no voice except for navi 's annoying quot;hey!&quot and an occasional quot;hello&quot from her or link 's grunts it 's got some awesome music one thing i love is the short ocarina songs you play such as song of storms zelda 's lullaby and song of time plus general area music although the overworld music is n't like what it was on link to the past it 's still great story the story starts off with link having a bad dream about a mysterious man and woman then link is summoned to the great deku tree where he fills link in on his quest and it goes from there even though it can be a quite simple story it 's just a huge epic story that kept me interested gameplay the infamous z targeting system that 's spawned several developers to use it in their own games the recent star fox adventures uses this your c buttons are for your weapons b is your sword and a is your action button(talk jump climb etc you 'll know this system by heart cause navi tells you how many times about it within the first hour camera is excellent and the z targeting helps even though you might be able to find this i suggest you pick it up dust off your n64 and dive into what is one of the 90 's most critically acclaimed and commercial masterpieces ever
this is by far the best zelda installment yet much more fun than majora 's mask mainly because you can freely explore the world of hyrule see review of majora 's mask)this game can be fun for anyone
i confess- i 've never played a single zelda game before this- cause i was n't into rpg games but i 'm so glad i never gave this a miss one day i   just felt like playing this game and i bought it and it 's terrific no   maybe better than terrific it 's too good to be true i spent 4 good   months playing this game and i finally beat it recently but that has n't   stopped me from planning round 2 and buying the brady guidebook to find all   the secrets this game is also filled with charatcer interaction and   drama i think you can read amazon 's review for the storyline and i 'll just   encourage you to buy this game if you haven't it 's a player 's choice   game and coming from nintendo- i am not surprised it 's this good i 'm gon na   get majora 's mask when it comes out this winter and i hope to see this game   on the dolphin if you are hooked and want to relive the magic- go get an   old nes or snes from your cousins or someone and buy the previous zelda   games and you 'll see why zelda 's a classic like mario zelda has a huge   following and blah blah ... i do n't need to elaborate on the game 's success   anymore as far as fun gameplay story graphics sound replay is concerned   it 's a safe bet to say that i will give every category at least 9.5 out of   10.i'll only give it a 10 when they put in fmv and put to rest once and   for all that zelda is the definitive standard rpg and action rpg and not   final fantasy sorry guys i had to say it- it 's true now if only   majora 's mask would arrive sooner ... oh i ca n't wait
the legend of zelda ocarina of time is a definite classic i 've owned this game for a good 6 years and it 's just extraordinary and fun but at the same time educational in this game you must do alot of thinking and find out where the secrets are so in other words it 's a magical adventure game the graphics are actually good for it 's time and the gameplay is easy to get used to the controls are also simple and the whole storyline is just well thought out and i can definitely tell that they put alot of time into this game in my opinion it 's the best zelda game so far now i will tell you the beginning of the story so you can even feel more excited about getting this game as a young baby boy your mother was killed by an evil person now you have no home and have to move to a place called the kokiri forest this is a place where people never grow up and are n't allowed to leave the forest they 're called the kokiri but you 're different you really do n't belong in this forest instead you belong out in a world called hyrule you 're a hylian normal people who actually grow up you 're out there to defeat ganondorf ganondorf most likely the person who killed your mother is a strong and evil person who wants to take over hyrule and become the king the only person that can stop him is you link now the question is will you be able to defeat the mean and evil ganondorf and save the world of hyrule?if you think or know you can take that responsibility then i suggest that you buy this game along with the n64 if you do n't have one and experience something very special like i said it 's a definite classic and will keep you entertained for hours on end you wo n't regret it!thank you for reading and i hope i was helpful enough
the game was awesome zelda has always been an addicting mindblowing and fun game many people like it the game features a great 3d world in which there is night and day the game also has many different enemies and dungeons and the famous ocarina where you can play different tunes that you have learned a really good game if you like action and adventure the frustrating thing are the puzzles they may take some time to solve this is not why i gave the game 4 stars i believe 5 stars means the game is perfect and this game is not perfect
i 've beaten the game 20 times and i 'm still not bored of playing it if you have n't played this game then play it you wo nt be sorry you did this is much better than all the other final fantasy and rpg crap out there
this is one of the best games i have ever played   even shooting the arrows is fun you can actually use your shield to block getting hit   just incredible   the only bad thing i can possibly say is you almost have to buy the strategy guide or else you will likely get stuck on some levels   there are a few dungeons that i could not find my way out of without buying the guide   but overall great game
zelda oot is centered around a massive circular field called hyrule around this field are pathways which lead off to various different locations such as dungeons castles villages volcanoes etc ... each path will lead to usually one destination like a castle and once explored you travel back across hyrule field and visist another pathway which leads to a different location this makes areas more accessible and it makes backtracking as less tedius as possible due to the fact that you 're not endessly travelling through pre explored ares backtracking is an important feature of oot due to the fact that when you progress through the game you aquire objects which give you the ability to explore areas more thoroughly ... bombs for instance blow up walls that hide secret paths hockshots give you the ability to ascend to higher ledges the ocarina of time opens secret doors thus pre explored areas which you thought were unimportant can in fact conceal the most important instruments and dungeons in the game this is compounded when at one point in the game you aquire the master sword this is a special sword which upon claiming makes you and the world age by seven years and by doing the reverse putting the sword back in it 's mold makes you and the world 7 years younger the good thing about this is that the past and future are profoundly different the future is controlled by evil whereas the past is controled by good needless to say your mission in the game is to liberate peice by peice the future world from the evil ganondolf however in order to do so you must travel back and forth in time creating situations which will have an impact on the future world a main part of this game is the ocarina of time depending on what tune you play the ocarina will turn night in to day make it rain open secret doors or make blocks disappear amoung other things   this adds an important layer to the game for you have to use your brain in order to work out which song is necessary to progress for instance after spending hours wondering what to do the idea could suddenly hit you should i play zelda 's lullaby in front of the waterfall if successful the waterfall will stop and a passageway will display itself thus giving you a tremendous satisfied feeling the actual songs you learn in the game are some of the best songs in computer game history in fact only computer world by kraftswerk can compare to the greatness of the music in oot.by the time zelda oot was released the difficulty in games was just perfect your heart was racing when you met a worthy adversary you were fustrated when you died you were delighted when you succeeded fustration and anger are both necessary in games because it 's those feelings which make you truly delighted when you succeed ...   unfortunetly since oot games have become so easy that a huge part of the joy in completeting them is n't there anymore
i have to say this is the absolute best legend of zelda so far ...   but there is one thing i have to clarify this is not the first legend of zelda   the first came out on the nes and is great to play ....   this one has good control fun plot and will get you so wrapped up in it you 'll come screaming back for more
i got this on the gamecube collector 's edition and really it 's confusing how they didn't make this the best game of 2000 2001 2002 and 2003 they did make it the best game of 1998 and 1999 but anyways there 's a master quest version out there for gamecube the sites are beautiful and when u get inside the deku tree let the action fantasy begin
whoever hates this game should be shot this is one of the greatest games ever it 's the best of link gamespot gave it a 10 anyway enough prasing it on to my review ... graphics 10/10 looks really good for the time big vast valleys long mountains clear water beautiful guts of jabu jabu ... sound 10/10 clash ahhh haha   hiya beautiful ocarina sounds boomm!music 11/10 beautiful music ocarina songs are deep and moving composed beautifully gameplay infinity/10 awesome go through many dungeons filled with tough enimies and hard puzzles talk to people in town play many minigames stealth this is   extremely fun and addictive hidden items you can also find 99 gold skullutas play an ocarina controls are flawless!one of the greatest games of all time do n't play it live it!ps why has amazon combined oot and mm into one it 's confusing and it 's depleting the rating also gerry atrick the reviewer above me was that troll review even nesscery you said to contact you   if anybody knew how to get out of the deku tree well 1 look on a gaming site and 2 how can anybody contact you if they do n't know your address and no there is n't a cheat to make link naked it 's e rated ah well whaddya expect from a guy from ireland ...
zelda quot;occarina of time&quot is much like the rest of the zelda series ... it does n't disappoint with really cool items to collect and using your songs spells to warp around the entire game offers whole new dimensions things such as a horse you can call and run about the world play carnival like games to win power ups collect hard to find items such as the two handed sword which is better than the master sword but you ca n't use a shield magically powered arrows and more!this game is fairly easy to beat but finding everything will take you much longer
you must own this if you like games it 's spectacular in every way perfect it creates a breathing world you care about and love while having this awesome deep story and adventure
this game has crossed the i like you line it 's just like the old one from nes although i know about the dungeons and the weapons because i have the old one so it 's fun to play for a while until you get to the water temple it gets confusing there so use the player 's guide to cheat so that you wo n't get stuck i played a long time ever since it came out it was the game that caught my eye and though i had to have the game i am a zelda fan and i hope that you have fun playing it as well i just like to see link grow up
the most recent loz games in my opinion have all been fairly average   wind waker was the latest actually good loz game   but of all the loz games oot is just plain incredible in this game you play as link as he grows from a child into a young man while on his quest to defeat ganon and save the world from ultimate evil rule   along the way you meet many friends and face amazing boss battles the graphics at the time were just incredible   it really made me enjoy looking at and playing the game   nintendo really did a great job in this department the gameplay is like no other   one of the few incredible games to utilize the c buttons for vital controls this game felt really comfortable to play and there 's tons to do in the game besides just beating it   also throughout the game you are forced to travel back and forth through time and play as young or adult link to complete the game which is awe inspiring in my opinion   sadly after doing little everything there 's no addictive mini games to really play and not much else to do but go through the game again and again the sound is incredible and the music has never been better   i found myself turning the volume on the tv all the way up while playing this game because the sound was that good!if you 're an avid gamer yet you 've never played this game then something 's really wrong with you   pick this game up and play it till your fingers fall off which i guarantee you 'll do   this game is worth buying and owning for as long as you even are alive
the best game for the n64 if you are to have 5 games for the system it needs to be mario 64 mario kart smash bros banjo kazooie and zelda
this game is a real gem treasure it and treat it well it is worth any price
wow ... what can i say as i 'm writing this review the popular   consoles right now are ps2 gamecube and xbox i have all of those yet no game on any of those systems are better than this this is probably the best zelda ever(i have yet to buy the one for gamecube deciding between this and majora 's mask is a tough call but i think this one gives a little more gametime how should i begin to describe this game it 's deep engrossing and the graphics are spetacular for a n64 yes the newer games right now definitely have better graphics than this but this game beats all of them in terms of gameplay music and theme the story is old but hey it 's a classic formula why change it what would zelda be without dungeons this is one of the few 3rd person games i 've played with great controls the z targeting system can change a traveling mode link instantly to a combat alert and maneuverable link the music fits the moods perfectly from the dark shadow temple to the light and cheery music of the lost woods it 's great buy it it 's worth your money and it 's probably the best game ever for n64
the legend of zelda has always been a series that continually delivers amazing games that are at the top of their class   the legend of zelda has always been my favorite video game series of all time since i was little and their games continually suck away hours of my life   this is the game that made me truly love gaming(before i just did it for fun   it also set the stage for other great games such as majoras mask wind waker and twilight princess gameplay   if you have played any of the other zelda games you will know that you play as link a young kokiry boy who must go out on the adventure of a lifetime to defeat the evil ganondorf and save princess zelda   the controls are flawless   you just move the analog stick to make link move move forward and press a to roll press b to use your sword the c buttons are home to you other weapons such as the bow hookshot and the like   this game introduced the revolutionary lock on system where you just pressed z and staid locked on to an enemy which meant no more aimless sword swinging it realy made the combat more managable and much more fun   like any zelda game there is a huge overworld to explore   you have grassy plains tall volcanic mountains serene lakes sandy deserts difeerent towns and villages and lots to do   the overworld is just enourmes esspecially for an n64 game   hyrule feild stretches in all directions   one of the great things about traveling is part way through the game you will get a trusty horse named epona   riding around hyrule feild is just realy addicting   there are many great minigames to do as well such as the shooting gallery bombochu bowling selling mask and fishing yes fishing   there are also special task to do such as collecting ten special poes(huge ghost that appear in hyrule feild or collecting 100 skulltullas(spiders of a horrible curse   the meat and potatoes is of course the dungeons   each dungeon is completley uniqe and different than the last one and shows off alot of great elements   there are many challenging puzzles that reward you when you figure them out   you raise and lower water look for paths that are invisible with the lens of trooth push giant blocks with the silver gauntlets use the megaton hammer to push blocks and much much more   each dungeon is just very well crafted that it is hard to beleive that it came out in 1998   there are many feirce enemies in each dungeon that fight to put an end to your quest such as stalfos bats lizolfos armos iron knuckles jellyfish tektikes readeds skulltullas and so many more   the boss battles are each intricitley desighned and completely different than thre last in the way they look and fight   the boss battle with ganon at the end is one of my all time favorite final battles ever(only rivald by the fight in twilight princess and mother brain   the difficulty is always just right with the challenges and enemys getting toupher as you go on   through the game you get alot of fantastic weapons to use such as a bow hookshot megaton hammer hovor boots silver gauntlets boomerangs and much more   each is always put to good use and none of them ever go absolete and are awlays usefull the whole way through   one of the big mechanics is of course the ocarina itself you play it manually with the button layout being like the holes in the real thing   you can change day into night transport across the world map and open passage ways with you trusty instrument and much more   the biggest suprise is after you get the master sword and travel forard in time seven years   time travel is a huge element in this game as some things you do as a child will effect the things you do as an adult and vice versa   there are also different things avalible to do in each time and it is a blast to go between two time periods and it realy makes you feel powerfull   nore matter which aspect of the gameplay i am talking about i can not find fault anywhere absolutely perfect story   hyrule was created by din nyrule and farore they left behinf the triforce which lies in the sacerd realm   many years later an evil man named ganondorf seeks the triforce and places a curse on the deku tree and does other horible things to many races   the deku tree tells navi the fairy that she must awaken link as he has been having a nightmare about the evil man   link goes to get a sword and sheild and goes to see the great deku tree who asks him to rid the curse   link succeeds but finds out that he is far to late   before dying the deku tree tells him the legond of the triforce and gives him the spirituall stone of the forest the kokirys emerald and then tells him to go to hyrule castle to meet nprincess zelda   link goes to hyrule castle meets princess zelda who tells him of the dreams she has been having about ganondorf and ask link to get the other two stones link obliges and gets them but finds that it is to late as princess zelda and impa flee hyrule catsle zelda throws him the ocarina of time   link then comes face to face with ganondorf and gets a taste of his power   zelda then telapethacally teaches him the song of time   link goes to the temple of time and plays it at the alter where the stones are placed and opens the secret chamber where he finds the master sword   link being the legendary hero takes the master sword but finds that he has fallen into ganondorfs trap   he is then seald in time for seven years where he is awakened by the sage of light rareu   link discovers that he is now an adult   and instructs him to find and awaken the other sages   this is where the game gets epic but i wo nt spoil anymore fore suffice it to say it is a great story that is very well told and will keep you wanting to find out what happens next graphics   these graphics were truly groundbraking and ahead of their time back in 1998   the moment you step out into hyrule feild and se the scale and distance you will be mesmerized   the game shows off some fantastic day and night sequences as well as many different colors   hyrule market looks and feels alive the kakariko village will look like a town with houses and shops   the desert esspecially is arguablly the best way to show off the n64s power with snadstorms and wind effects   the charecter models are great for lnik to zelda to ganondorf to the bosses to even the npcs   the enemys realy look feirce and different   these graphics truly set the standerd in 1998.sound   the sound effects themselves are spectacular like the flowing water the clank of a sword hitting a wall or an enemy the enemy sounds when thay are struck bu the sword or when they are attacking lniks yelps and much more   the game features a brilliant musicalll score koji kondos work is reminiscent of john williams almost and that is not a comparison i make lightly   you will hum the beat of the lost woods love the powerfull melody of the temple of time be entranced by the song of storms there is just so many great melodys that i have lost count   the song of time is truly memorable as well as all of the others   my only complaint might be the lack of the traditional overworld thing and navis annoying hey listen screams but these are all tossed aside once you hear koji kondos work at its finest with the lost woods theme and song of time replay value   i still play this game nonstop   it truly proves that amazing agameplay oulives any other aspect of a game   there is just so much to do and so much to see and so many places to explore that you will never want to drop the conntroller this game is my favorite game of all time and is a must buy for any n64 owner or enouph of a reason to get one if you do not have one already   it is also avalible on the wii vertuall console and is well worth the download   this is the game of my childhood and i cannont stress enoph how much you need to get this game
i got this game a couple of years ago and i was completly shocked it was really fun and addictive but takes you into a new world called hyrule throughout the story link has to save hyrule from ganondorf who makes hyrule look like the devils mountain but if link collects the right items he might save hyrule with the princess of zelda graphics 5/5 the colors really standed out with the houses grassland people etc!gameplay 4/5 it was a challenging game might be hard to follow through in controlling but z targeting helps you alot using new weapons such as swords sheilds bow n arrow hookshot etc was usfull in beating storyline 5/5 the story was copied by the old zelda from super nintendo but made into a more better world more places to explore and more side quests to do!overall 5/5 my opinon i thought it was a game that everyone even zelda fans should get it for your collection once you beat it you can actually go for more side quests items to get and other things you missed
a good game comes along entertaining millions of fans worldwide then a year later another good game comes along and steals the fisrt ones place ever since the beginning of game history every good game that came out eventually got replaced by a better game the next year since sept. 98 that cycle has been broken stopped by one game that never got replaced even by it 's sequals nothing ever ended out better than zelda ovarina of time this game has revolutionized 3d gaming with its z target system it has enchanted and bewildered people with its magnificant storyline it has taken the lives of thousands of people because of all the side quests and collectible items in it this game i am predicting will probably still rain supreme until the next system comes out the one after gamecube its z targeting system makes link the main character look at an enemy within this looking he can circle around it in stategic patterns accurately aim and strike the sword without missing and hitting air a yard away and eaily and quickly dodge and backflip attacks many games even nowadays imitate this system but fail to get it as correct and perfect as zelda did does the storyline starts off telling of a magical forest with many never growing children in it all these children have one compainon fairy with them except one boy who does not right from hearing this setence in the game for the first time you know your in for an adventurous complicated yet slightly realistic storyline that will take your life for at least a month and this game has many many side quests to do there are 100 special spiders to defeat and get treasures with 50 magic beans to be planted and give a passegeway to unaccesible areas 25 heart pecies to collect to get a whole lot of health with 15 masks to sell and play around with 6 empty bottles to collect a chicken to rais and a huge trading sidequest that eventually leads to the possesion of the strongest weapon in the game and much more this game also has the perfect sound to it the cheerfull happy nature of the magical forest can be perfectly heard in it 's background music the adventurous wide and far meadows of hyrule feild are perfectly expressed in it 's background song the fast paced and action packed lives of the desert theives is clearly expressed in it 's song everywhere you turn in this game you are greeted with a new background song that sings perfectly the attributes and unique features of that place and transations perfectly with whatever the player link might be doing in that place this game 's sequal majoras mask suffered horribly from the lack of this and the prevous games in the series did nt meet this either one more thing though i 'll admit it to the world i hate the main zelda theme i 'm glad its not in ocarina of time in a game that so clearly stands out with it 's music one old sounding bland song that dosnt fir well with hyrule feild wouv'dv ruined the experience of going out of kokiri forest and seeing it for the first time oh i forot to mention that part too the game has a perfect attidude for adventure in it the places are designed very well and when mixed in with the fabulous background music gives a feeling of adventure that is completely unparelled to any other game whatsoever the first moment you walk out of the small and cramped kokiri forest which actually used to seem so big onto the your first grasses of hyrule feild the sun will blind the screen for a moment and as rising reveal this spectacular wide open feild with a tuft of trees a monstor here and there a ranch in the middle and a clear blue sky with a brightly shining sun along the feild a rise in elevation starts as you climb the hill you can see even more than you could before a magestic huge catsle a winding clear blue river a deep valley a menancing volcanoe and a huge lake along with a tuft of trees and a monstor here and there as you travel to new places you will feel almost the exact same feeling of adventure too when seeing the towering windmill of kakariko village above the small humble houses of the village below it with the perfect backgrond music for example with this great feeling of adventure huge enviroments much huger than even the ones of nowaday games and a great storyline and absolutly stunning soundtrack ocarina of time is the greatest game of all time until a greater game will come out wich will probably take a very very long time if you do nt already own this game shame on you you should buy it immediatly and while waiting for it to ship download an emulated version now or else
seriously it 's one of the worst games ever terrible graphics especially compared to the ps triple 's no voice acting boring puzzles and above all it stars a little fruity fairy boy who wears green panties and never hits on any of the babes in this game plus why is the main villian black that 's racist!for a good zelda game i recommend link the faces of evil the wand of gamelon or zelda 's adventure
this game is just sickeningly good and nothing else since has matched it 's gameplay depth charm design and atmosphere it is absolutely flawless and perfect when it came out 3 years or so ago i was hooked to it immediately and i finished it in about a month but since then i finished it around 10 more times and i still enjoy playing the full game today after 3 years it is that good the controls are absolutely perfect and the targeting system works perfectly for most combat situations the atmospehere of the levels of the game is just the best ever in a game to date for example in the mysterious forest the lost woods u can actually feel it 's mystery from the excellent music getting louder as u reach it 's source and the way the whole place is designed no videogame fan has an excuse not to play or own this words can not describe my love for this game sounds stup[id but it 's true you will so nostalgic even when u meet the characters again for the 20th time it is just a gaming masterpiece and i doubt it will be bettered for a veeeeerrryy long time to come unless the new gamecube zelda follows the same direction and improves it with a larger interface and new fresh ideas buy it it or u will miss out on the best game ever yes the best game ever ..   all i can say is if u have nt for some reason buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it ...
zelda 64 is defenetly one of my favorite games for the n64   it has a fairly good story it 's interesting enough to make you want to know what happens next and it has a gameplay that 's unbeatable   the combat system is very simple and great   you have your z locking on system which makes killing enemies a piece of cake   there is so much to do in this game that it 's comaprable to a good rpg something that n64 has n't been blessed with yet   the graphics are pretty good especially since they do n't use the expanssion pack and the world is just huge   one down side is that some puzzles in the caves can be pretty tough and sometimes you may feel lost and do n't know what to do next the bosses look very impressive and get more challenging as you progress through the game   this game will defently take a couple months to beat unless you play 24/7   after you master the game then it 'll just take a couple of days like any other normal or great game   nintendo has defenetly done a great job with this one   one thing i did n't like about it is that it has gotten eaiser than it 's predicessors i 've started playing zelda games since the snes days   back then it was zelda a link to the past   the game was tough   i 'll admit it it took me a year to beat that that game was also huge   but now 3d has made things eaiser which i like and do n't like   but another thing i do n't like   they keep on changing the whole story of zelda those of you who played the snes game will know what i 'm talking about   there link did n't live in a forest and there was n't a guardian fairy   and the whole world changed too   well maybe it 's for the best but i would n't mind if they made a remake of it maybe for the gba .....
i came across this game in 1999 and immediately recognized it from the cartoon from back in the 80 's   i played it just to try it and i wound up getting so addicted i had to buy it for my n64   i would stay up til all hours playing it   it 's rare for a game to hook me like that but this is one that is challenging yet fun so you ca n't help but say okay i 'm a try one more time then i 'm turning it off and still be playing a couple of hours later the water temple was the biggest pain for me because i tend to rush into things and would n't do things right as far as the puzzles went   i loved the forest temple as a kid   the weapons are easy to use and play a role in a fair share of what you do   the boomerang has a few uses such as getting items that are out of reach hitting switches and killing enemies   the ones i loved were bombs except when i got too close to them   loli do n't remember much else about the game since it 's been a while since i had time to play it   i do know it took me quite a while before i managed to get some things such as all the poes and golden skulltulas but no matter how many times i play this game it does n't lose its appeal   like i said it 's challenging but not so hard that you throw the controller down in frustration and give up it 's the second easiest game of the three zelda 's i 've played   twilight princess although very in depth was easy and majora 's mask was the hardest but only because i kept running out of time when doing certain tasks   ganon was hard for me to kill at first but i think now that i 've played it enough and therefore fought him enough i know what to expect and i can now anticipate what he 's going to do and react accordingly all in all i recommend this game even if the system it was made for is pretty much a thing of the past
this is a game you could fall in love with when i first played it immediatly after it came out i was so engrossed and enchanted with it that it was like the real world disappeared and there was just me and the game this never happened with me with a video game before the scenery is breathtaking and some of the music scores are beautiful although i think the music in the first forest dungeon as an adult is absolutely creepy the dungeons are puzzling at times but not too hard and the bosses are challenging enough you may have to try them several times but do n't worry you can eventually beat them the game has a built in save feature so you do n't need a memory card and you can save anywhere in the game do n't have to wait for any specific save point that is real nice you start out as a 10 year old boy and then after 3 levels you travel through time and become an adult hyrule has changed and you need to save the land you go through many levels and bosses to finally get to gannon the ultimate evil here he is an improvement on the previous gannon of previous zelda games(looked like a little pig then and fighting him is more challenging and engrossing in this new game there are other little side adventures thoughout the game to entertain you when you want a break from dungeons and monsters this is a high quality game fun for kids and adults
wassup fellow gamerz   nubs   lulz my parents just bought me the legend of zeldo collector 's edition for my 14th birthday it features this legend of zeldo oracana of time game i enjoyed this game very much ... even tho the graphics suck i will give you some of my thoughts now!my favorite part was when the main character link pulls the supreme sword from the stone in the iceberg temple oh man glammondwarf the villain was so cool he snuck into the secret realm behind link and stole the trueforce of strength   pwned!the prince zeldo person was really weird   he she was a tranny who turned into some guy named shaieke who kept stalking link on his journey then he she would change back into an elf girl in a dress what a creep   but zeldo had the trueforce of smartness so i guess that character was okay zeldo had this tall white haired ninja lady named inca as a bodyguard inca might have been a man too though ... i'm not sure   she looked kinda like my aunt helga the link character was really cool   link wears white tights a green toga and had a grappling hook device he also has this little firefly thing called navely that follows him around you begin the game playing link 's little kid brother which kinda sucked   i ca n't pwn goombas with a little midget goombas are these big skeleton guys   i think the kid brother is supposed be peter pan after he killed captain hook and left neverland maybe they have another game about that part).but later you get to play link who is an adult elf with a pointy nose he has the trueforce of braveness so that means he is very brave he can throw dynamites into walls to blow them up and reveal secret buried treasures i wonder if the treasures were hidden by magic pirates   later on link gets the bassoon of time and can play it to make it snow i think link is kinda mentally handicapped though because he never talks he just goes ugh hiyah aughhhhhh and stuff i think he might be a cannibal or vampire too because he eats hearts to gain health there is a really annoying beeping sound that reminds you when it 's time to feed you pick up these little colored diamond things called rublees that you can use to buy stuff with but they look really big so i wonder how link can carry so many in his pockets and if you do n't pick the rublees up soon enough they begin flashing and disappear i guess they 're like ... big holograms or something like in star wars   why are there so many rublees hidden in the grass and under rocks i really wish i could mow my parents lawn in real life and find money like that there are these fish people named zurros they have this giant jellyfish named mr. jabba jabba and you have to go into his stomach to retrieve an ugly little talking fish man i think it was the zurro king 's pet and he lost it but you have to carry it all around mr. jabba jabba 's stomach so it 's kinda annoying then there are these big rock guys called gordos that like to roll down mountains they are my favorites because they live in this mountain called doom mountain it explodes like a volcano and tries to kill you   holy that evil glammondwarf guy is a member of the garundo thieves they are a bunch of ginger women that live on a beach but they do n't have any men in their race so i do n't understand how there are so many garundos maybe some of them are trannies like zeldo   i think glammondwarf might be one he kinda sounds like a drag queen when he laughs sooooo all of these people live in this magical land called hirole with a bunch of weird cartoon characters i think it 's supposed to be kinda like toon town from roger rabbit it 's such a huge place it takes forever to ride across it on link 's horse ramona that 's right you get a horse link steals it from mario and luigi at some ranch so i guess link is kinda a thief maybe he 's really one of those garundo thieves he does kinda look like a girl   but he 's not a ginger so i 'm not sure aaaanyway .... play this bassoon of time game it is full of so much win   i hope i did n't give too much of it away   lulz!!11one   xd w00tkid95-
the legend of zelda ocarina of time is simply put the best adventure game i have ever played i 'm a newcomeer to the zelda series so i 'm not too sure how ocarina rates with the others but i love it for an nintendo 64 the graphics are absolutely beautiful the lighting rivals that of a playstation 2 or xbox or game cube the sound is terrific each different sound effect was done in detail the sword against stone and the sword against wood are not the same as in a lot of games and sound just like they should the echos when you enter the room and the monsters roaring in the distance are incredibly realistic and link 's footsteps are done perfectly the puzzles are challenging but not so that you want to through the controller down in frustration but so that you wo n't put the controller down until you 've figured them out the minigames and the sidequests will keep you playing long past the time you 've beaten the game itself because they are so plentiful the controls take some getting used to but are perfect for the game 's combat system the targeting especially helps the later you get into the game the music is captivating and is very well done overall i think this is one of the best games ever not just in adventure it 's definetly a game anybody with a nintendo 64 should have
what a game   i have played zelda for nes snes and now the n64   a link to the past was a great game but this is the best zelda game   the graphics are graet   teh temples are huge   this is the best game for the n64   majoras mask is great too but this one is better   sp i reccomend this game to everyone   it truly is one of n64 's best   ca n't wait to see zelda on gamecube
i love this game you ca n't say that you are a zelda fan if you do n't own this game this game features an awesome storyline unforgettable characters and just keeps getting better you could play this game forever and not get tired of it if you have a n64 system you better own this game or if you have a gamecube you should have the legend of zelda collectors disk
unless you 've been living in a box your whole life chances are you 've heard about what an incredible game this is nay i will go as far as to say perfect even if you have n't grown up with the zelda series you 're still likely to find this game quite enjoyable it 's safe to say that this game was nothing short of revolutionary and it continues to be one of my favorite video games of all time the story begins as a young link awakens in a small tree hut staying true to past games you start off with no items or weapons you soon learn that the great deku tree wishes to see link and thus you set out to explore kokiri forest upon taking your first steps outside you meet the elfish inhabitants of the forest while you search the area for a sword you have time to get accustomed to the controls and the environment once you have sufficiently explored the forest and gathered the required items you head for the great deku tree accompanied by your faerie friend navi after completing this first dungeon the deku tree explains the history of the triforce and rewards link with the spiritual stone of the forest thus setting the story in motion the graphics of this game are fantastic for its time you can now journey through a fully navigable 3d map the details of the environment properly capture the mood of each setting be it a forest village a watery temple a haunted underground maze or the inside of a giant fish 's belly the map of hyrule is pretty expansive and full of places and objects to explore the cinematic sequences look great and tie the segments of the story together well i absolutely love the controls in this game everything is pretty intuitive the a button is used to execute actions the b button swings your sword and the c buttons allow you to store up to three items to use during play you 're able to roll and jump swim and climb block attacks stab and build up power for swing attacks but the greatest addition to the control features is the z targeting ability this function allows you to lock on to people and enemies and focus a particular action on the targeted object moreover this button will focus the camera directly behind link allowing you to have control over your point of view to this day i compare games camera controls to ocarina of time often wishing for that very desirable z targeting capability a great addition to your supply of character controls the story itself builds upon previous games in the series for we interact with familiar characters like zelda and ganondorf in addition to many new individuals as always there are a whole variety of weapons and items to collect during your travels some that are familiar and some that are new to this title what makes this game even more engaging is the idea of traveling through time you begin the story as a child growing as a warrior and searching for the spiritual stones when you travel into the future the world has become darker and your missions more challenging there is a constant interplay between the past and the present as you try to make your way through the dungeons and numerous side quests the multitude of puzzles games and items to collect makes this story very immersive and entertaining the endearing characters that you meet provide for a rich enjoyable plot furthering your adventure along with their dialogue and aid and the game would not be complete without sound again ocarina of time gains a perfect score here the sounds that link makes when he fights moves and interacts with others are both enjoyable and believable the echoes that your character makes are varied depending on what type of environment he is in likewise the soundtrack is just as appropriate each level has a different musical score and each song blends in beautifully with the surroundings also some of the songs are familiar tunes from the previous games transformed just right for a sound that is nostalgic yet new the ocarina songs are appealing as well adding another interesting component to the gameplay ocarina of time really has a wonderful soundtrack and even today i still enjoy listening to it all in all this game is truly a classic and yet another impressive sequel in the zelda series from the sensible controls to the superb storyline to the awesome soundtrack ocarina of time is a gem in the adventure game genre
simply the best   great story great graphics great control great replay value   it is true n64 was nt that great of a system with pretty horrible games   i bought it back in 98 and up until i got my ps2 i only bought a few games for it   zelda ocarina zelda majora goldeneye perfect dark and dk64   there may be other good games but this game is by far the best not just on n64   but possibly out of all video games ever   trust me people if i say it is good it is good   i do nt give out good reviews very easily
the legend of zelda ocarina of time is really awesome but how awesome is it the best of the legend of zelda series so far oh undeniably but that is not the point my point is that it was the best game for the nintendo 64 with super mario 64 and its direct sequel majora 's mask in a second place draw it shows how the franchise began link sets off on a journey to save hyrule from the evil ganondorf for the first time he meets princess zelda on the way and when she flees from ganondorf she leaves the legendary ocarina of time in link 's possession he uses it to travel through seven years with the help of the master sword the graphics were neat for the time the storyline was really exciting and there is a lot of stuff to collect the dungeons were challenging and the boss fights are neat if you are a fan of nintendo please pick this up you will be glad you did
with almost three years in the making how did the legend of zelda ocarina of time stand the test of time itself as a prequel to the entire legend of zelda series it has caught heavy anticipation ocarina is a prequel to the events before a link to the past link is a child whose destiny is to save the land of hyrule from ganon gannondorf here by traveling through time you 'll meet up with other characters in the adventure and interact will fellow hylians kokiri zoras and other civilations who aid you on your quest to save hyrule ocarina of time is one of those controversial games that the series has carried all along in the end the game is an action rpg and should never be classified in the style of traditional turn based rpg 's like final fantasy).new additions to the series are automatic jumping and z targeting the emphasis of the zelda games has always been puzzle solving and dungeon arrangement you also build your attributes receiving items including the ocarina learning songs whose purposes range from teleporting to opening doors to time traveling along with mini games hidden items and side quests equal its a worthwhile experience graphics wise hyrule never looked better and most effects in ocarina of time are outstanding no need for sharp visuals and smooth framerates but rather focus on detail and designer talent the real time cutscenes and the passing of day and night are impressive the sound also holds its own on this cartridge format the themes of zora 's domain and gerudo valley are music to the ears zelda fans will remember tunes of kakariko village and zelda 's lullaby a big plus is that all the sound effects from previous zelda games have made a comeback in the end the legend of zelda ocarina of time makes the cut even though the gameplay consists mainly of dungeon dwelling and puzzle solving the impressive graphics quality sound and everything that 's been obtained from previous zelda titles will keep fans and non fans alike entertained it 's fun
ok i figured i 'd throw in my opinion as well mainly this review is for people who have not played the game yet and are wondering if they should perhaps you are n't too into rpgs or whatever so it is my job to convince you first off it 's more of an rpg adventure combination since it does n't use conventional rpg techniques like turns or experience but that is a good thing because the way the game is structured allows for near total freedom as you play it yes like some people have said you must beat the dungeons in a certain order but there are about a million other things you can do whenever you want and that just expands the boundaries of this game even more it is truly the greatest game i have ever played that is no exaggeration the graphics and the sound are wonderful the puzzles are not as easy as some people are saying -- the water temple is maddening -- and the character development and depth of play is unmatched majora 's mask is almost as good but what makes ocarina of time better in my opinion is the fact that it is sort of the quot;ultimate&quot zelda game meaning it starts from the beginning and recreates the entire story of link and zelda and ganon and it is a completely stand alone and definitive game majora 's mask on the other hand takes place right after the events of ocarina of time and has a very different structure the three day cycle you must live through makes for an extremely enjoyable game but the only downside is you ca n't take your time and relish everything like you can in ocarina of time either way though ocarina of time is a beautiful game
the best game i ever play   in fact i beat this game in a week   it 's a good deal and is worth the money.(big time
i have played many many many video games in my life and this game is literally the best game that i have ever played in my life it 's nice and long like all the other zelda games it has a perfect level of difficulty there are so many different weapons in the game there are so many memorable dungeons and fields in the game well i could go on forever i wish i could give this game a higher score than the measly 5-star rating amazon.com forces me to give but alas i can not if you own a nintendo 64 buy this game right now if you do n't own an n64 you can still buy it for gamecube it 's the same exact game i own it for both n64 and gamecube if you like this game then buy the sequel too it 's called majora 's mask i 'm telling you you will definetly not regret buying this game if you are a die hard zelda fan ... or even if you are not a die hard zelda fan although i do n't know who would be reading a review of a game that was made in nineteen ninety something in 2007 ... if you are reading this buy this game right now and if you don't you are missing out   everything about this game is perfect ... that is all
this is the 2nd best game i 've ever played even if i like excitebike 64 more i ca n't wait until i can get this i do n't have it but my brother and i got all the way to forest temple from the start in just 3 days then we had to return it but it 's my favorite zelda game ever
face the facts all these young gamers in the world do not know what it is   like to grow up with a legacy on your tv screen   i do   upon first playing   of the oot i found it to be quite exhilirating and as game play continued   i was reminded of the greatness of those that came before it   yes the   game was a little difficult but if you whine about how you could n't get   past the first level either gain some skills or do not enter the arena   with true gamers   if you did not play the original zelda you will not do   well with this one   this is by far the greatest zelda of the series and i   ca n't wait to see what the future hods   true gamers you know what i mean
ocarina of time is definitely the best game on the nintendo 64.super mario 64,perfect dark and f zero x are awesome but ocarina of time is the best out of any other game on the system what else is there to say about a game that changed the way we look at role playing games forever?the graphics are awesome(some game cube games do nt look this good the music adds excitement and the challenges are excellent whereas the difficulty in super mario 64 stayed pretty much the same throughout the game ocarina of time gets harder when you get to be a better player also you get an extra heart after beating bosses because you ll need it its very challenging i still have nt beaten it and am not sure if i ever will easy games can be a lot of fun but they just are nt as substantial as a game like this the challenge makes it fun as well as the graphics and controls its just a great game and is a must for any zelda fan or just someone who loves challenging games
what is n't great about this game i 'm so glad that this game has so many reviews because it definitely deserves it ocarina of time remains one of my favorite videogames of all time yes the generation of gaming is getting wider and graphics are getting beautiful with each console but the legend of zelda ocarina of time on n64 does n't add up to them well at least to me it does n't i 've seen a few 1 star reviews about people bashing the game only because it 's no everquest or halo this game is so good that you do n't compare its style or graphics with something in today 's modern gaming this is an old school game you just do n't compare old games to new ones i believe there 's a favorite for every generation this one happened to fall into the n64 genre when gaming was really starting to pick up and honestly you think over 700 5-star reviews were written all by children we were children when we all played the game and looking back as adults now we cherish it as a classic and one of the best in videogame history kids that did n't get to exprience the nes snes and n64 missed out on a great gaming genre and though the generation of gaming today is awesome there 's nothing on the classics ocarina of time remains my favorite game of all time even before some of my new favorites and there 's nothing like turning on that n64 and playing over and over again i never tire of this game it is a true classic
game type role playingsystem n64graphics awesome especially for its timedifficulty moderate it depends if you want all the items and secrets or not not hard just to beat however age recommendation 12 and upcharacter quality love themplayback value there is always something fun left to do!gold cartridge availability i have one :p they do n't make them anymore but you may be able to find one used link the courageous hero of time must save hyrule and princess zelda from the powerful wizard ganandorf along the way link will meet many people who can help him on his quest as well as provide items and host mini games to make it more fun can link defeat ganondorf and save the triforce buy this game and become part of the adventure travel through time to play both child and adult link ocarina of time never gets boring or tedious and is neither too hard nor too easy for any level of gaming skill if you missed it in 1998 it 's time to get it and get in on the action the sequel majora 's mask is also cool
once again hyrule is being threatened by the forces of evil as link the chosen hero you solve countless puzzels and fight many many monsters!this game has about everything good graphics great gameplay and a wonderful story ganondorf the evil in the game needs to get the tree spiritual stones to open the tempe of time he threatened the people who have them but they did n't give him the stones link goes on quests to get the tree stones once he gets them and zelda the princess gives him the ocarina of time   he opens the temple of time but little does he know ganondorf followed him seven years later link wakes up and ganondorf rules hyrule he spreaded five of the six medallions and had monsters gaurd them you get the only medallion ganondorf did n't have and go on a quest to find the others this game is great and has a wonderful selection of weapons and other things i highly recommend it and for anyone who has a nintendo 64 get this game for your 64 collection is n't complete without it
i remembered a time my older brother borrowed this game from a friend of his i liked it so much but when it came to the time for my brother to give it back i was upset but no worries i was 7 at the time when that happened now that i 'm older i was able to buy my own copy
one of the best games of all time you get the thrill of beating all the bosses playing the ocarina and riding epona around hyrule never going to regret getting this game one of my favorites
the legend of zelda ocarina of time may be difficult at times for some of the temples were designed to make you think but this game is the best game i have ever played in my entire life i have been playing nintendo for years and i have played some of the older zelda games before but i never owned any as soon as i tried this game i immediately loved it and i 've played it millions and millions of times   i am so obsessed with it i went out and pre ordered the wind waker to get the zelda bonus disc and renewed my subscription twice to nintendo power to get the zelda collector 's edition disc there is no need for me to review this game all i really need to say is buy it   you will not be disappointed if you are a nintendo fan or have a brain   definitely be sure to get the follow up majora 's mask and the wind waker   a must play and link is the best hero ever
man i remember getting this game when i was around 9 years old and alll those hours i spent beating this game over and over again i gurantee i 've beaten this game at least 100 times honestly though the n64 is outdated from time to time i take it out of my closet and plug it in just to play this game i hope the twilight princess will be just the same
go out and buy it and play it yourself and see what i mean ok the level 's are great and there is alot to do the places that you go are in the mountain 's lake 's valley 's and in cave 's and a little ranch somewhere link lives in kokiri forest in the game you have to get three stones somewhere one in the deku tree and one in goron city and one in the zora 's domain some time in the game you will be older by the time you look around the place will be dead you as link and you have to save the world form evil form the evil king name ganondori and his evil plan 's before it 's too late and save a beautiful princess name zelda and you get to meet other characters in the game too some are cool some are big and some are small buy the the legend of zelda ocarina of time official strategy guide it 's a big help to me and you if you with it everything revealed to you.ps i know everything in the game do you i play it and i love it
if you have an n64 you absolutely should have this game it 's a remake of the classic zelda game from the good old nes and snes systems with some added twists new terrain and interesting characters if you have a gamecube i would recommend you pre order the upcoming title quot;the wind waker&quot and if you do this right now nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of quot;ocarina of time&quot for game cube not just the good old quot;ocarina of time,&quot made famous on n64 but also an enhanced version called quot;master quest.&quot make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value happy hunting
this game is fun but it is very overrated it has not aged very well and the game feels sloppy compared to how revolutionary it was when it came out
when i first got my gamecube this game was part of the zelda collector 's edition i did n't know much about zelda and had only played very few games before but was mesmerized by this game the beginning of it is so magical and imaginative it really draws you in to the story i found myself playing through the beginning of it over and over again because i did n't have my memory card yet this game takes place in a vivid fantasy world that is vibrant ominous beautiful and haunting i had never experienced anything like it to this day i have never been so absorbed by another game what 's really impressive is that this whole game is very consistent the music is also exceptional the music is better than most movie soundtracks in my opinion all of it perfectly accompanies what is happening in the game so much happens in this game it has a lot of cinematic scenes too which really develop the story which is an excellent tale of good versus evil ocarina of time stimulated my imagination at a young age more than just about anything i know of there are a few films and books that would come close but i ca n't think of anything that could quite surpass it ocarina of time is an involving authentic scary and epic adventure playing it for the first time makes for an unparalleled experience
this is one of the best games   you have to play it   it is definitely the best game in the zelda series so far   it has adventure romance mystery and so many subquests   it 's about a boy named link who has a destiny   he lives in kokiri village a little tiny village in the land of hyrule   anyway a little fairy named navi comes and says that he must meet the deku tree   he does and the deku tree tells him to go inside the deku tree and destroy all of the evil monsters inside him   link does this and the deku tree gives him the kokiri emerald or the spiritual stone of forest   the deku tree phrophesies that ganondorf an evil desert gerudo man is trying to get hold of the triforce the essence of life in hyrule   but in order to get hold of the triforce you have to get three of the spiritual stones   unfortuantely after the tree 's prophecy he died because of the curse ganondorf had cast upon him   but link and navi go on their journey and get the goron 's ruby or spiritual stone of fire and the zora 's sapphire or spiritual stone of water   link gets the ocarina of time but when he opens the doors ganondorf gets in before him and he gets the triforce   link waits seven years in the chamber of time and when he awakes he 's all grown up   rauru the sage of light is there and tells him that he must save all the sages from their temples and receive the medallions   he receives the medallion of light forest fire water shadow and spirit   but the game   it 's definitely one of the best n64 games around
there comes a point when sooner or later one has to admit that they have reached a mile stone this is it look no further than the game that changes everything that went before it yes certainly other games can compete graphically with this but innovation is an entirely different proposition zelda then innovates on an unparalleled scale weather night day age all real aspects which merely touch the surface of this monumentous achievement to be really honest there is no real weakness with this game no puzzle will stop you in your tracks there is always something to do in fact it will take you a lot longer to find everything the game has to offer than it would to finish other games and this is where the distinction comes in you can label this as an adventure game if you like but it is beyond comparison with everything else thus meaning that it should be catagorised in a genre by itself or at least as a game that redefines an entire genre there are no comparisons forget other inferior games that try and emulate and better this forget the games that rely on pretty visuals to impress zelda has all these and so so much more buy this it is that simple
classic game a favorite when i was a kid still fun to this day i just wish the graphics were better got to remember this game is from 98 and one of the first 3d games of it 's time great game
the legend of zelda ocarina of time is an incredible game and is one of my top ten games of all time but it is neither the best n64 game or the best game in the series it is the second best of both the best n64 game is mario 64 and the best zelda game is the wind waker that said this is one of the most innovative most fun and most interesting games of all time the overworld is huge there are a ton of items and weapons to collect throughout the game and there are plenty of interesting enemies and bosses to fight ocarina of time is a true classic presentation- 90/100graphics- 98/100sound- 96/100gameplay- 99/100replay value- 96/100overall- 97.5/100
there 's many that love this so called masterpiece but the only thing i like about this boring repetitive game is the great soundtrack sticking to the superior original
i remember all the hype surrounding the legend of zelda the ocarina of time like it was just yestarday the zelda franchise has always been among the best to grace any video game system and with the power of the soon to be released nintendo 64 the series was finally going to reach its next step the third dimension this along with other titles like super mario 64 and mario kart 64 got both gamers and the press excited about the n64 and the upcoming zelda game while the nintendo 64 never quite managed to live up to all its prerelease hype the legend of zelda the ocarina of time managed to not only live up to its respected hype but in many ways surpass it what makes toot special imo is the fact that it is the first game that i 've played where you truly feel like a part of its world many games tried hard to accomplish this feat including previous zelda titles but toot was the first game to finally get it right even the later majora 's mask never quite managed to create the immersive world toot did much of the game 's feeling stems from the interactivity of its world you can spend hours exploring a certain area and still have not seen everything there is to see for example many of the game 's locations have these hidden holes you can jump into and find hidden goodies as well as hear some pretty haunting music once you obtain the stone of agony however you find out that these randomly placed secrets are only the beginning i wo n't go into too much detail here since you need to play the game for yourself to really appreciate it another thing that makes this game feel more realistic than previous zeldas is character interaction remember how decidedly generic a lot of the npcs in zeldas ii and iii were in toot each and every npc is given at least some sort of personality so that you can easilly distinguish him her from the rest of the game 's characters as well as once again feel like you 're a part of hyrule and of course the third dimension the dimension we live life through helps the game a great deal the gameplay is equally great i especially liked how you can hold three items at a time rather than just one which is especially helpful in the game 's dungeons which often require you to use several different weapons items speaking of which the dungeons have some of the most clever puzzles and interesting layouts of any game i had ever played and i really liked how once you completed all the puzzles in a dungeon you opened a new path from its starting point straight to the final boss rather than simply having to run through the entire dungeon all over again after death the way you did in previous zeldas this was especially annoying in a link to the past where the dungeons were much longer and more challenging than in the original legend of zelda and of course the game 's graphics are among the n64 's best not necessarely because of how detailed realistic they are but how carefully crafted and full of life they are and the soundtrack is among the best ever to grace a video game even with the star fox 64-quality midi samples).in brief the legend of zelda the ocarina of time is an excellent game if you own an n64 and have not already picked this game up i strongly suggest you do if you do not even own an n64 than the system 's worth picking up just for this one game and its semi sequal majora 's mask
this last year of 2003 et did a survey about the best video game series ever zelda one there poll and this game is one of the reasons why ocarina of time tells the continuing story of the zelda universe in the zelda timeline it takes place before the other games as usual you are the hero link you must save the princess zelda you have different quests you must finish and many obstacles that will block your way the story is that ganondorf the evil wizard is trying to take over the world equipped with the ocarina of time you will travel time in your quest to save zelda hyrule and the world this game is jam packed with stuff to do i 'd say you have a garunteed 40 hours of gameplay it has all the classic zelda weapons and more you get to ride a horse across the country side and do some impressive underwater work there are just so many impressive factors i love this game i ca n't thing of words to describe how good it is if you have an n64 your collection is not complete until this game is put in it
let me put it like this if i had to destroy every videogame i own except one this is the one i would n't destroy this is simply the greatest game ever made i 'm not going to insult this game by trying to describe the storyline or graphics etc .. you have to experience it for yourself most helpful thing i can do is tell you how you can get to play this this game has had dozens of ports one came on a bonusdisc for gamecube with windwaker in 2003 and another came in a collectors edition master quest also for gamecube if you ca n't get ahold of one of these the original for n64 or a rom you should buy a wii and download it from the wii virtual console it will be worth the while
i really should have the kids writing this i think they liked this game but yet there was something lacking in all the zelda games
zelda is eailsy the best game i have ever played   the graphics are excellent you forget you are playing a game   my dad thought it was a cartoon   the story is wonderful too   i wo n't give anything away but i almost cried at the end   and the music is great   you will find yourself humming the gerudo theme song   i highly recommend this game but i suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one ... it 's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else ... i had to start over about three times   but the replay value is good too that 's why i give zelda 5 stars
seriously as awesome as the games before and after this game are there is truly no touching oot the story is amazing and well thought out the game play is simple the music is suburb and all console zelda games stem from this right here such as excellent game there is no surprise many gaming magazines regard oot as the greatest zelda game or video game ... of all time
back in the late 1990s i wrote two articles for a now defunct game website about ocarina of time one is a review of the title and the other is the how in many ways ocarina of time feels like a remake of the eternal snes classic and my personal favorite zelda game the legend of zelda a link to the past rather than leave them unposted i issued them on amazon back in 2007 one article on the collector 's edition zelda 64 a remake and and one on the regular edition an actual review of the game when the 3ds version came out i wrote a review of that and included both articles on the review as well for bonus content originally this review only featured one of the two articles i am now putting both articles up mike london 9 9 2012 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------this commentary on ocarina of time was written as a gaming article for a retro gaming site back in may of 1999   i was going to post it on amazon but for some reason never got around to it   mike london november 3 2007article 1 does zelda 64 really live up to all the hype?[blurb with all the hype its hard to be objective about oot.   is it the best game in the series or does it have to settle for second or egad third best   is it like star wars episode i all special effects and no substance   find out a few thoughts from a fellow gamer!]the legend of zelda ocarina of time is easily one of the most hyped games of recent gaming history   in fact i think i could safely say it is the most hyped game yet   there is only one thing that can compare to it in terms of hype and this product is in an entirely different industry   star wars episode i had the same amount of coverage   being a big fan of both of course i 've beat the game and have seen the movie   and they have one thing in common   they 're both eye candy   but how do they hold up to the rest of the series   in my opinion the empire strikes back is by far the best star wars movie   but what about oot you ask   how can i defame such an instant classic?one reason mainly   in the original and in the legend of zelda link to the past i ca n't speak for zelda ii because i have n't beat it yet the ending was spectacular   not the game ending for the legend of zelda was produced in the stone age and there was much ending wise but the last dungeon   ah the last dungeon   only recently like december 23 1999 have i beat the first quest of the legend of zelda   that last dungeon on death mountain was a killer a true challenge that you had to match your mettle with to get past it save princess zelda and beat that nasty ol' gannon   it was truly a great dungeon   now skip on past those five years between the release of the original and the snes version   what have we here   a dungeon comparable to that in the original legend of zelda   everything is bigger and better in the snes version including the last dungeon   whew and i thought the original was harder but no way!then in 1993 we see the release of the game boy version of zelda   the legend of zelda link 's awakening was released to a very receptive crowd   but guess what   no end dungeon   in terms of dungeons this is the smallest of the zelda titles again not including zelda ii   you beat eight dungeons and then you go and beat the wind fish   personally i 'm half a dungeon away from completing this zelda game dungeon seven which i completed half of went and beat eight and now i 'm back on the last half of vii   that last dungeon was challenging granted but what about that classic end dungeon   no where to be found here   granted it 's a game boy game and it is huge for that consol   so that offence is not to serious   and we did get a new dungeon though not the ending i was hoping for with the colour dungeon on dx which was the rerelease of the classic game for game boy colour after five long years the legend of zelda orcarina of time was released for the n64   so cool   link in a 3d adventure   about time too   mario the cash cow counterpart to link got his 3d adventure way back in 96   of course i bought the game   and of course i beat it   it is an excellent game   truly it is one of the great classics   but one flaw keeps it from edging out the legend of zelda link to the past   the end dungeon absolutely sucked   that is my only disappointment with that game   as i was nigh the close of the shadow temple i was really looking forward to getting into gannon 's tower   i was expecting a great closer dungeon just like in link to the past.[spoiler if you have n't beat the 64 version of zelda do n't read this]what did we get   instead of a great closer dungeon we got a door way that was blocked by barriers   what did we have to do   go thru six rooms and beat whatever was in them then go and shoot the barrier corresponding with each temple to open the pathway   and what did i get   a great disappointment   sure this might have been a good way to end a novel or something but to end a zelda game like that was horrible   the game boy was forgivable and acceptable but this ending to zelda 64 was truly despicable   that has been my biggest disappointment with the zelda series.[spoiler finished]others say the legend of zelda ocarina of time is the best zelda game   i have to disagree   do n't get me wrong   it is easily one of my favorite games of the n64   it 's a great game very innovative espically that nifty z targeting feature and an epic in its own right   but for what the system is capable of the legend of zelda link to the past beats it out of the coveted title of best zelda game   lttp is huge   it fully utilized the snes technology   it had a full twelve dungeons two of which the sole purpose was to beat the bad guy and not try to retrieve any medallions or crystals or pendents or pieces of triforce or what ever   that 's one more than the original has   loz has one closer dungeon for each quest   after you beat the bad guy twice you go and fight ganon   there were plenty of side quests for an snes zelda also   overall for the system 's capabilites lttp is my favorite but what about the legend of zelda oot   my two chief complaints are these:1   weak closer dungeon as i spent a good time detailing up above).2   not enough bad guys to kill in the overworld all other zelda games including the black sheep of the family zelda ii has plenty of bad guys to kill in the overworld   but what have we in oot   a few measly skeleton dudes at night and some giant flying plants that you can hardly get too in hyrule field   give me the old zelda with bad guys streaming at you in every new screen   for all the time they put into it you do n't think it would be to hard to correct this problem then we come to another mistake nintendo made in the n64 version of zelda   granted loz had two main tracks one being the overworld theme and then the dungeon theme   they could have had more variety but it was back in the stone age   that overworld theme became pretty much the theme of the entire series   and guess what they decided to omit music wise from oot   the overworld them from the original loz   i could n't believe they did that   hopefully we 'll see it in zelda gaiden   maybe the triforce will show up in that game too   just a thought now after railing on oot for a great majority of this article you may think i hate the game   quite the opposite really   it 's a great game and worthy to be in the zelda series   gee it sounds like i 'm defending zelda ii which i 've already done in a separate article   but it has been the single most hyped up game in the history of nintendo and it is totally out of balance   great 3d game but would have been better had it corrected the problems i stated above   it 's a fun game and i had a great time beating it   it provides a lot of enjoyment   but just like star wars episode i it just ca n't live up to all that hype   i wonder if any game or movie could actually.[may 9 1999   an article originally written for nintendoland.com   i 've written four released articles and one unreleased article dealing with smb 2   it will have to be edited   also perhaps incorporating part of the structural symmetry article.] ..... --------------------------------------------------------------------------article 2:[originally this was written for a retro gaming site back in early january 2000 it has never appeared on amazon.]zelda 64 a remake?[blurb zelda 64 and snes zelda has several similarities almost to the point that the basic game design of zelda 64 is a remake read here for more information on this intriguing phenomena just a few thoughts from a fellow gamer!]after playing the course of the legend of zelda ocarina of time i 've noticed something very intriguing about it it seems to be a rehash of what i feel is the best zelda game loz link to the past why do i say this i say this because there are several structural symmetries that lie between zelda 64 and lttp.lets examine it for one there are three pendants you have to acquire in lttp this is after you go and rescue zelda and leave her at the temple well this time around you do n't rescue zelda but you do go and talk to her after that when you get the three pendants you go and she is kidnaped this is after you get the master sword in the lost woods in zelda 64 you go thru the first part of the quest getting three spiritual stones after you get those three spiritual stones which i think the tower on lttp is much better than that d----- lord jabu jabu 's belly i hated that dungeon you go to the town guess what as link approaches there it cuts to a cinema and zelda is kidnaped by ganondorf hmm have n't we seen this story before it turns out that you have to get 5 of the sage 's medallions rauru conveniently gives you one so we can cut the sixth one away only by getting the six sage medallions can you open the bridge to fight ganondorf how intriguing in the superiour snes zelda counterpart it is seven crystals and you do n't get one given to you link wakes no sages this time instead the seven maidens of the wise men descent have been hidden in deep dank dungeons and link has to transverse thru 13 dungeons all together 5 the first part and eight the second part they are challenging fun and intriguing granted zelda 64 has some great stuff but it is not as consistent as lttp after you have gone thru the seven dungeons two more than in zelda 64 you now have all seven crystals that 's great now go to death mountain and by doing so you will open the way to ganon 's big bad temple okay what do we have in zelda 64 you go and get the five medallions plus the one that rauru gives you as link guess what now you have to go to his tower and open the rainbow bridge with the six medallions hmm is n't that what we did in snes zelda why i do believe it is watson!another issue yet addressed is the light world dark world zelda 64 does the same thing save this time it is time traveling i 'm not even going to go into the impossibilities of time travel on this that 's a whole separate article in itself in snes zelda you have a little mirror the old man gave you there are eight transporters located thruout hyrule transporting back and forth if you are in the dark world you can use the mirror to go into the light world making a temporary transporter well in zelda 64 there is no mirror or transporters the closest to a mirror is the lens of truth found nigh in the shadow temple but if you go and put the sword back then you go back to being young that creates two versions of the same world to explore that structural symmetry corresponds to lttp not only that but at the end if the first three stones link goes to the temple of time and gets the sword this is after the three spiritual stones goes into place hmm is n't that what happened in lttp after getting the three pendents link goes to the lost woods and retrieves the master sword but he can not do that until he has all three pendents well that 's the same in zelda 64 he ca n't get the ocarina of time now can he retrieve the sword until he wins the corresponding three spiritual stones i swear i 've played this game before the real question is why did nintendo do this well miyamoto is a great gamming god but as far as stories go his team is not that good at having connecting story lines that make sense again another article another time the structural symmetries lying between zelda 64 and lttp is quite frightening who knows why they chose to do that granted the story line is different but quite a few of the fundamentals behind both pieces are indeed the same in review a listing of structural symmetries between snes zelda and zelda 641 snes first part link goes and retrieves three pendants after rescuing zelda this is to get the master sword upon doing so and after giving the pendants up to retrieve the sword zelda is kidnaped.2 n64 link after receiving a mission from the deku tree goes and wins the three spiritual stones upon doing so he goes to hyrule city but not before learning zelda is kidnaped he places the three spiritual stones in their place and the door of time is opened and there the sword is retrieving the sword goes to the temple of sages or whatever it is called is given first sage medallion.3 snes after winning the three pendents link must now go between two versions of the world light world dark world link must go back and forth between the two worlds to beat the game.4 n64 in this great stunning adventure link must go between two versions of his world one is when he is young the other when he is an adult this is achieved by putting the sword back in its pedestal just like in snes lttp link have to go back and forth to finish the game when he is an adult things are noticeable more evil for ganon 's power has grown.5 snes one version light world is good because not corrupted by ganon version ii dark world is an evil corrupted version of the light world.6 n64 one version young link 's world is not corrupted by ganon 's evil ganon has just recently showed up version ii adult link 's world is an evil corrupted version albeit older of young link 's world the only difference is in one its two different versions of the same thing in zelda 64 it 's the time barrier but for game play they 're the same.7 snes he link must recover seven crystals hidden in seven dungeons sounds logical with the maidens power they will open to door to ganon 's castle.8 n64 link has to recover five medallions to open ganon 's tower.9 snes the massive closer dungeon is a tower.10 n64 the weak closer dungeon is a tower.11 snes after beating ganon you save zelda who had been kidnaped although one could argue you save her in turtle rock she is still imprisoned in the crystal with the other maidens each in their respective crystals.12 n64 sticking to the standard nintendo story after recovering the medallions and beating ganon guess what link saves zelda there 's a shocker.13 snes there are various mini games heart pieces and extra things to do this trend is continued in link 's awakening also.14 zelda 64 stuck with the trend of mini games four heart pieces to make a heart and extra things to do.15 snes in some of the houses you can find a picture of mario on the wall.16 n64 in zelda 64 after meeting zelda look out the window and you can find some pictures of mario luigi bowser and the princess yoshi also comes up malon and talon wear bowser amulets also just goes to show nintendo likes cameos as you can see for yourself the various structural symmetries between zelda 64 and snes zelda is quit a few if miyamoto wanted to do a remake of lttp for n64 that 's what he should have done i suppose this as far as story goes is pretty much an update with little changed its like they took the game 's basic plot changed the circumstances and added where appropriate but allowing the basic structure to stand and although both are great games sadly snes is better consistently with each dungeon getting a little harder and more complex but i love ocarina of time all the same this just helps support my believe that nintendo is first and foremost a gaming company not a writing company.*in all previous zelda games the end dungeon was in the mountains this is the first game in the series to break that trend the first three zelda i ii and lttp their dungeon was in death mountain link 's awakening link 's only game boy adventure currently is in tal tal mountains at least we have something that broke one of the several trends running thru this classic series
this is one of the best games i have ever played   i love the gameplay   it was easy to control the character   i also enjoyed how it was n't a very easy game   when a game is challenging i play it more and more   in fact i still play this game today   very good game
this is the 2nd best nintendo 64 game to date right behind golden eye 64 we all know that golden eye 64 is impossible to top but this comes damn near close zelda ocarina of time is a classic five stars plus matter of fact this is the best zelda release i have ever played and i have played them all the graphics really show what the nintendo 64 is capable of putting out along with other classics like mario 64 and golden eye the graphics are amazing and are top notch the storyline is even better most good rpgs have more than just one single character this game however only has link and still manages to become a classic like most of the other zelda titles no this game is no final fantasy iiv but in a way this game is better maybe not as long but the storyline is a little bit more creative and catchy ocarina of time offers a little bit more quot;extras&quot than the previous zelda titles have to offer you can collect extra items along the way for personal score to see how good your discovering ability is and not just finding pieces of hearts there are so many secrets with this game i would suggest you do nt use the strategy guide until you have completed the game if you do then you are cheating yourself and making the game not even worth playing beat the game and then look at the guide to see what you have missed overall i spent a lot of time on this game i could have beaten it a lot faster but that would nt be any fun because the fun part is discovering the secrets within the game itself buy the game and see for yourself this is nt exactly a hard challenge of a game but it is nt exactly that simple either just right get it today
note this is the gamecube collectors edition version)i remember ten years ago seeing the commercial for this game i always did wonder what it was like after getting the collectors edition i immediately got started on it the story focuses as always on link link is a young boy living in the kokiri forest one night he has a nightmare and wakes to discover a fairy named navi who will help him through his journey he is overjoyed but then discovers that the gaurdian of kokiri forest the great deku tree is dying from a curse the tree passes along a spiritual stone and recommends to see princess zelda link does so and zelda tells him to get the other two spiritual stones so link can get the master sword to stop ganon king of the gerudos from entering the sacred realm and stealing the trifoce a divine relic link achieves the other stones and the ocarina of time link draws the sword and finds out he has been tricked by ganon who entered the sacred realm link awakens seven years later and after discovering he is now an adult meets rauru the sage of light according to rauru the only way to defeat ganon is to awaken the five sages that is where the true quest begins wow what a story!now the graphics are not bad by today 's standards neither are the dungeons they are amazing and also very complicated.(please do n't mention the water temple).overall this game can be summed up by one word perfect buy the game become the hero and have the time of your life
ocarina of time is a massive epic action adventure game out for the n64   many have been tempted to call it the best game ever just read some other reviews but i would step back from that   it is still one of my favorite games despite the fact that i play mostly rpg 's   by the way zelda is not an rpg even though you do talk to people and have a sword in zelda you play as link zelda is the princess not the main character as you go on a quest to save the world from the evil ganondorf by freeing each of six spirits from their different temples   you change between times where you are adult or child link and you have to switch often and do different things in both and each time has different weapons and items   the time traveling aspect of the game is one of the coolest parts the real time combat is a lot of fun and fairly well put together   it involves a z targeting system in which you can select a monster and then keep it in the center of the screen and move around it   the fights against other monsters with swords and shields are great as a result   z targeting is not perfect but it works well the dungeons are all awesome and very unique   each dungeon is mostly based around one particular item or weapon its own gimmick but despite that they really do n't seem forced and stay fresh all the way through although the last couple dungeons are n't nearly as long as the others almost like the designers started getting bored   for the most part the dungeons are n't too difficult if you know what to do but it is very easy to get stuck if you do n't and the game often leaves you on your own to figure out what to do especially on side quests so having a good walkthrough nearby is helpful the overall story is n't too great for the most part save the princess but many of the individual events and side stories are neat   the characters and different races which populate the world are cool especially the gorons which are one of the best races ever   the bosses of each dungeon are awesome as well as being original and can usually be beaten by hacking them up or through the use of special tactics   it 's always good to have a choice despite how good it is zelda is n't perfect   the graphics for example are nice but they are old and on the n64   the music is okay but mostly just ambient and the classic zelda overworld theme is conspicuously missing   having to constantly change which items you have equipped is also annoying even if there is n't really a better system available   some would say zelda has an almost kiddy atmosphere and suffers from an occasional lack of seriousness i would tend to disagree   and of course the fairy is annoying but no reason to like the game any less all in all zelda is a great game and a must buy for any n64 owner as it is one of the best action adventure games ever   if you are looking for an rpg look elsewhere   this is n't one   and be prepared to get a little frustrated   zelda is pretty long especially if you do everything there is to do   maybe 25 30 hours if you run straight through but   it could take many more depending on how much extra stuff you do or how often you get stuck   have fun
i first started playing ocarina of time from a good friend of mine the graphics are really cool and it shows realistic images of stories i do n't see why anybody would give this game only 1 star i sure enjoyed the good pictures of this game next time i 'm in a video game store i am going to buy this game first of all the adventure begins when this little boy is at home sleeping a fairy comes to him and wakes him up then you have to find this sword and find the great deku tree i never get tired of this game because you travel to different places accomplishing many tasks there are many items you can use too!i think the legend of zelda ocarina of time is even better than most playstation and playstation 2 games it is just that good to me if you ever see this game in a store buy it you will have a good time with this game
this is truely the best game for 64 becuase link is so cool this is probabaly the best zelda game ganondorf is the man and you beat him in this game if you have nt played this game i do nt know but anyways in this one you could be big link and little link not like in majoros mask where you could only be little link this game is way better than majoros mask if you still have 64 get a gamecube so you can play windwaker)you need to get this great game
this has been deemed the best made game of all time and even though it 's going on 15 years since its release i ca n't disagree people complain that this game has no replay value is too easy and the graphics are n't good well i 've revisited this game several times since it came out in 1998 and i have n't found a lack of replay value there 's so many sub missions i do n't see how you ca n't think of this game as novel and new every time you replay it this game has a perfect balance of gameplay for first time gamers and extra sub missions for experienced ones think it 's too easy obviously you have n't gotten all the heart pieces found all the skulltulas earned all the jars achieved the biggoron sword or caught the hylian loach any one of those tasks would create a challenge for anyone complaining about the graphics sorry the game is n't on xbox or playstation format in 1998 this game had state of the art graphics as i am in the process of beating this game for a third time in 2011 i still do n't find the graphics something to complain about this game excels in both gameplay and storyline i find it hard to believe that anyone who has played at least half this game would say they hate such a masterpiece
from a graphics standpoint this was and still is the best legend of zelda ever the story was great as well as the gameplay all and all this was a great homecoming for the hero of hyrule great game from beginning to end 10 stars
an excellent game for those like me who like adventure and a new challenge zelda will leave you amazed in the game you must save your world by fighting evil monsters solving puzzles beating bosses and temples etc and getting the items and weapons etc you need in order to achieve these and other goals you are the world 's last hope can you save everyone and defeat the evil ganondorf in this breathtaking adventure game
miyamoto slacked off on this one.1.this is certainly not the best game ever not even the best game on nintendo 64 super mario 64 and perfect dark both stomp this game into submission.2.this is not a role playing game role playing games have a lot of text and character involvement this game has a script that is about two pages long maybe less what you say or do in this game really has no effect on the games out come.3.this is not the best zelda game the legend of zelda links awakening and a link to the past are all much better games especially for their time.4.this game is not 256 mega bytes it is actually 256 mega bits which is equal to 32 mega bytes so sorry the game is n't nearly the size of a 650/700 mega byte cd rom.5.the game has no replay value i played through it once then about a year later i attempted playing through it again i could n't bare it the game is just too boring i played through final fantasy vii and viii twice each and those took alot longer than this to finish they were both great both times through i loved the good old zelda games but this just does n't deserve the zelda name lets just hope that zelda on the game cube does n't turn out the same way
this game is truly phenonemonal from the amazing graphics for what it is a n64 game to the music to the challenging gameplay to the engulfing storyline the legend of zelda ocarina of time is a must play for any age you start the game off as young link or whatever you want to call him who lives in an enchanted forest where young never grow old inside the forest there is a godly tree who could be considered to be infinitly wise the tree senses link has the power to overthrow a great evil which is arising and tests him to the dungeon inside of him link comes out sucessful and the tree tells him the story of the great evil which is arising from then on you play young link and must overcome many obstacles as a child there are 3 dungeons and the tree 's counts as one so you 're making some time right wrong there 's much more to this game then beating dungeons as a child you ca n't acess as many of the things but after you advance 7 years to the future and attain the master sword many of these things are then open to you as a child you got an ocarina in which you must learn songs on to access special places or do special things now you can do all those things and more my personal favorite is epona 's song in which you place a horse 's epona song and it comes to you in which you can ride across hyrule field to get to places twice as fast as a child you have weapons like a stick whoopey a sword a shield a sling shot and duku nuts as an adult you can handle 2 swords the master sword and the giant sword which is so big you must handle it with 2 hands which means no shield you also have the hook shot megaton hammer bow and arrows and magic crystals you can do different things with i can not begin to explain how amazing this game is i 'd buy a nintendo 64 all over again just for this now i have a playstation 2 and i still have my nintendo 64 but only play two games on it this of course and super smash brothers now do yourself a favor buy this game and experience teh magic yourself
10/10 one of the best games ever released on any console the story line is amazing it captivates you swiftly the game play is also awesome and the graphics evil bosses etc it 's just one of the best games in the market at some point we all wished to become link play a tune or two with an occarina and may day turn into night or draw towards you a horse named epona
this game rules it was very well conceived the storyline is good and the gameplay is awesome i rented it before and found out it is a game to buy and play trust me you will get your money 's worth good graphics excellent sound scores huge worlds and good characters pull this game together i am yet to find a game that matches it 's surperiority even majora 's mask was n't as good i 've beaten it several times through and sometimes wish that i did n't know it like the back of my hand
first off this game is very good considering it had very good graphics for an n64 and sound second of all the storyline is the best i 've seen in ages the boy from the woods that no one knows becomes the hero of time ... i would reveal more but i do not want to spoil the game third the gameplay and controls are easy to master so you probably wo nt be swinging your sword at an enemy when you intended to throw bombs at it like games with complicated buttons (; fourth the thing that makes zelda well zelda the dungeons the puzzles in them are chalenging and fun the scenery in the dungeons and everything else is amazing fith the enemies are unique and mystique making the worlds you explore even cooler overall this game is the top must have of the n64 gaming system ...
simply the best single player rpg i have ever played from start to finish you will not be dissapointed please if u get the chance go after majores mask its also a great game ..
i 'll keep this short as most people have probably already played this but when this game released in 1996 there was literally nothing like it no fully 3d adventure with the calibur of ocarina of time existed in those days the sheer quality of this game was unheardof in 1996 the graphics were smiply beautiful for their time and the gameplay was near perfection you start the game as a young kokiri boy living in the forest village with your friends and the old wise tree of life when darkness strikes your small corner of the world its up to you to delve into the tree and find out what s truly hurting and potentially killing him after solving the situation in your home a much broader world of discovery and adventure opens up to you and its up to you to save hyrule.after completing 3 childhood dungeons and playing the song of time in the temple of time you find yourself frozen in a time warp for 7 years waking up at age 18 i believe waking up in adulthood you make your way across 5 more dungeons before conquering the final fortress and facing one desperate final stand from the evil that s been behind all the trouble from the start truly epic in every way considering the year it was released ocarina of time is still the greatest game ever created in my opinion.10/10
since amazon is sort of combining ocarina of time and majora 's mask into one review i will write a review for both games both games have been remade for the gamecube and i own both the original n64 version and the gamecube version the gamecube versions were released if you bought a gamecube at a certain time and if you pre ordered the wind waker the legend of zelda ocarina of timethis game started out as you as the hero of time you were the only forest child without a fairy and the great deku tree sent the annoying little fairy to you when you go to the deku tree he says you must get these spiritual stones to open the door of time and a bunch of other crap like that sound and music 9.5/10.0 this game has one of the best scores in the video game world and the ocarina songs are very good 100 credit to the music makers of all the zelda games these are some great songs the only problem is you ca n't shut it off sometimes it gets annoying and it does n't help if you are stuck on a level for hours graphics 2004 4.0/10.0 1998 9.0/10.0 in this day in age the graphics are so good these look like horrible if this game was released today everyone would laugh back in 1998 these graphics were the best out there but the good thing about them is you can see the faces unlike some of those games fromt hat time it made you go blind difficulty 10.0/10.0 this game is hard i beat it barely without a strategy guide and you can be stuck on levels like the forest temple and the freaking water temple for months if you beat the game with a strategy guide you take the challenge and fun out of it you also wo n't have many broken items like controllers or tv's gameplay 1,000,000.0/ 10.0 it is considered the best game ever and was the 1998 game of the year you could do everything in this game and it is very fun doing all those side quests and other crap this game is like no other no other game can match this none of that final fantasy or any other rpg match it it is the best nintendo game ever made the legend of zelda majora 's maskthe game takes a huge turn in majoras mask as young link goes out with epona from hyrule no ganondorf 's in this game because it revolves around majora 's mask a mask stolen by this little imp from the happy mask shop guy from oot you have three days to get the mask back but you must keep going back using the ocarina and the song of time sound and music 9.5/ 10.0 it is like a carbon copy of ocarina of time and the suspensful music is very catchy the game has great music all zelda games have great music.graphics same as ocarina of timedifficulty 9.5/10.0 not as bad as ocarina of time but that does n't mean it is not frustrating and challenging you ca n't be scared away by the challenge of these games because they are just too great gameplay 10.0/10.0 the whole mask collecting concept is very fun and it a change from beating ganondorf like in all the other games you will feel deja vu of ocarina of time because the characters are the same just different the game is fun and a great challenge overall these games are classical n64 greats
legend of zelda ocarina of time is a classic   it should be played by every nintendo fan and fans who are not big on nintendo   the zelda series is infact a big popular series but this one defys all of them   ocarina of time is a stand alone zelda classic   it is not only the best zelda game but it is possibly the greatest game ever created on a console   the story line is oh so brilliant and the graphics(even for todays standard are unbelievable   anyone who owns a nintendo 64 needs this game   this game is pretty old and pretty cheap(i lost my game so i baught one for 5 bucks at gamestop)so it wo n't be hard to find   this game infact shows what the nintendo 64 is capable of   the game is very well made as you play through a huge world ... well not that huge ..   and i will say this .. (i may be exagerating this though but the legend of zelda ocarina of time has one of the best boss battle finale ending ever .. ubelievable .. graphics in this game a superb   there were parts in the game were i would just stand there and stare at the ocean houses anything cause it looked so beautiful   i loved how they created the bosses especially the last one and it was amazing how realistic they made the horse look   nintendo scores big with the graphics   the gameplay is magneficent   i loved how it was all made and done   i really ca n't get into this one you 'll just have to play this part for yourself .... the sound is .. my god ... it 's beautiful i even downloaded all the songs   i loved the song were your in the temple and you get the mastersword cause they made that song really well   the music in the farm were epona is was made extreamly well and was just brilliant   as i 've stated the story in this game is just plain good though it obviously has the save themed plot as you all know and i wo n't really get into the plot since there is already like 500 reviews saying what the plot is about .. sure the game is old and outdated i guess .. but so what .. the game is still one of the greatest games of all time   i 'll put it in simple words for you the game is flawless   the game has an amazing plot that will suck you in the gameplay is fun and classic(as well as riding epona the horse)and music is just plain beautiful the enviroments and atmosphere of the game as just as incredible as the game itself is and as i stated before ... ocarina of time is simply the greatest video game ever made(and if it 's not possible then it has hands down the best video game ever made no the best video game of all time) .... get this game you will not regret it!5 out of 5!!!!(if i could i would give it 100000 out of 5
this and super mario 64 are the best games for this console now this was the first zelda game i ever played and it 's gold cartridge now this is a zelda game that 's good to bring in the newcomer or link to the past this game is not too difficult but difficult enough the story is one of the best stories i 've seen in a video game very original the one thing about this game i do n't like are the water dungeons it 's a trend in zelda games to make the levels that involve water the hardest part in the game but it is passable in conclusion good game for newcomer and the best storyline to keep you hooked on the series
in this one of two installments in the zelda series for the nintendo 64 you once again take on the persona of young link or whatever you choose to name him as he embarks on a quest to save the land of hyrule from the dark forces of ganon   one of the great conflicts in nintendo history second only to that of mario and bowser   you start the quest as a boy and end up as a man   along the way you will fight many monsters explore dungeons and temples rescue a horse great for traveling through the world of hyrule quickly engage in numerous side quests and mini games learn many different tunes for your ocarina pick up a number of weapons and other helpful items meet some gorgeous fairies and in short have a wonderful gaming experience as with the other zelda games this one is filled with different puzzles of various types most of which you must complete in order to advance in the game   they are engaging but not too difficult to figure out for the most part   there are a few though that i had a tough time with   not to fear though there is plenty of help out there both in books and on the internet to aid you through those difficult spots   the controls are wonderfully intuitive   navigating through hyrule is much like controlling mario in super mario 64 and the game does at times suffer from awkward camera angles like mario did and there are good tutorials in the game itself that teach you the ins and outs of fighting monsters and defending yourself the z targeting system is excellent once you get used to it   you do n't really need it for some of the early monsters but by the time you become an adult it will be essential   in addition you have a little fairy buddy navi who continually travels with you and is always willing to give you helpful advice on what to do next after you complete a given task   navi will also help you with advice on the weak spots of the many different monsters you will encounter throughout the game as i mentioned before there are a number of side quests throughout the game   they 're not essential to finish the game but they are a lot of fun and some of them will get you prizes that will make the later stages of the game a little easier   one word of advice when you reach lake hylia be sure and talk to the two scarecrows   later in the game you will be glad you did   also be wary of purchasing too many items in the various shops and bazaars   they have many useful items but they are also very expensive and almost everything in there can be found for free in various nooks and crannies in the game   also be wary of gorons who want to sell you a giant sword   do n't say i did n't warn you ... although you do not need a rumble pak to play the game your gaming experience will be enhanced if you get one   the pak will be set off whenever link gets near a secret area which are sprinkled liberally throughout hyrule   these secret areas contain goodies that you really do n't want to miss out on all in all an excellent game which showcases the abilities of the n64 to great effect   games like this are why i will always remain a nintendo fan   but do n't take my word for it pick it up   you 'll be glad you did
this game is as good as the soundtrack and majora 's mask it is one of the best i've ever played
hey all you people this game is an absolute good barely any flaws and it is like you are playing the game in reality this is a 5 star game why you ask this is the proof:1.gameplay- it takes you a while to master the controls and stuff but with practice this would n't be frustrating at all!2.graphics- great as i said everything is 3-d like the deku tree and link himself take a look!3.lifespan- i heard that people who knows zelda games really well could beat this in a week but you guys out there that is starting a new adventure would last forever for no boring parts of the game there is a lot of words to say but its worth it.4.fun this game is a 99.8 fun game in my opinion of course i am stuck on the deku tree of how to get past the spiders see challenging and fun!5.sound you got ta be kidding me the sound and music is great different sounds occur in different environments for the better!listen closely!6.overall- this game is an absolute no miss game guranteed this is a good game who likes rpg or collects zelda games this is i think better than majora 's mask this game follows the legend honestly
like all zelda games the ocarina of time provides an adventure about link a young hero.in the ocarina of the player takes control of a young boy known as link right from the start of the game players jaws dropped at the sight of the graphics for 64 bit graphics it looks amazing.as the story progresses players obtain more items and link becomes more of a hero at about 2 thirds through the player becomes an adult and he ca nt use some of his items which is one the most impressive features in a game iv ever seen its about an ancient evil being restored and a child giving up his youth for his country there s nothing bloody wrong with this game its perfect.p.sthis game is why you keep your n64
legend of zelda ocarina of time is one of my favorite games ever   i just love the storyline and the characters even though link ganondorf and zelda have been in all of the zelda games but this game is the best   the original legend of zelda for the nintendo was okay but it felt like the game would never end   i recommend this game to fantasy lovers who also love the idea of a super villan an action ready hero   this is also one of nintendo 's classics   everything a fantasy story needs is right in this game
i m not even that far(i just got past those guards)but i can tell this is a classic example of electronic excellence and is a classic that anyone lucky enough to know its out there can discover
i played this game and never wanted to stop in my opinion this is the best rpg game ever it is fun just to play and run around the graphics are great and it is just plain fun what is also nice is that getting past certain parts of levels are n't very hard and you do n't get upset playing it pros:1 great graphics2 great plot storyline3 characters look great4 easy figuring out what to do5 just plain funcons:1 ummm
zelda oct is an action adventure rpg there is debate about this and some argue zelda is it 's own genre with a combination of puzzles fighting and racing anyone who enjoys this genre will be enthralled by oct which you can play on several nintendo platforms including the 64 and gamecube i still play zelda oct 10 years later on the gamecube from time to time it 's that good of a game graphics for the time period zelda oct on the 64 was beautiful and it has stood the test of time far better than other older games on consoles it was the first truly 3d game for a console and set the standard for what video games should look like if you grew up on newer systems and pc 's these graphics will look blocky to you but the gamecube has an oct version with more refined graphics still if you want a retro video game experience the n64 zelda oct has graphics that are still enjoyable today story the zelda story is perfect for a video game as the basic premise is always the same link a young boy or young man in newer games is the reincarnated hero of time he must battle the evil ganon ganondorf to save hyrule and princess zelda by using the power of the triforce zelda oct molds the zelda story into a fantastic tale that will take a least a few months to beat for your first time the game 's puzzles become progressively more difficult culminating in the notoriously challenging dungeon the water temple the story combines several races hylians kokiri gerudo gorons and zora seamlessly into one large kingdom the enemies are varied and interesting as well the fantasy adventure story line is complex and intricate complete with twists and shocks time travel and genocide time affects the characters and you see that not everyone loses when evil prevails the story details are amazingly deep to the point that pictures on someone 's wall and the clothes they wear can fill in some back story of that character i loved the detail and enjoyed filling in little pieces of the back story by talking to the npcs and looking through the first person scope at their tattoos and clothes the main story is also amazing with the typical epic sword clashing adventure ingeniously employed in the zelda oct universe it 's truly a master 's greatest work game play the 64 had a simple controller for fun game play there are only a few buttons a b z c pad r1 l1 joystick and the d pad the d pad is n't needed in zelda 64 this limited key selection was used to build an elegant fighting system around a few button combinations although b always attacks and a always does an action the genius of this system falls in the types of attacks you can do depending on the way your character is moving and whether or not an item is targeted link can perform an impressive list of sword attacks vertical cut horizontal slash diagonal slash spin attack thrust and jump attacks despite the fact that b z and the joystick are the only buttons that control these moves link is easy to control and i never had problems getting link to perform the combination of moves i desired link could cut any sign into 5 unique pieces consistently that is excellent controller response!in addition to the perfect synchronization of link to the game controls something newer games like dark souls could take a lesson on the game play is interesting and varied although the main fighting style will be slashing it up with your sword each monster has a unique weakness that you can take advantage of with a variety of weapons link not only totes a one handed sword and shield but he also get 's access to a sling shot and deku seeds boomerang hook shot bow and arrows bombs deku sticks deku nuts and two impressive two handed weapons a hammer and a sword these weapons can all be used in different ways to different effects at various times in the games although the game would have been interesting enough with just those weapons the game is further varied by magic link can wield three types of hand magic as well as three types of magic arrows this adds another level of monster fighting where link tries to find the weakness so he can move in and dice them up apart from the impressive array of weapons link also packs a varied wardrobe the stoic hero is far from interested in fashion i mean he runs around in a tunic and tights with a long cap so he obviously does n't care about his looks so each piece has a specific use you can mix and match boots and tunics for different benefits some bosses can only be beat with the right combination of clothing and shields and figuring out how to use which items against a difficult boss is part of what makes zelda oct a great game wait there 's still more to combat apart from the variety of moves and effects link can muster with his impressive array of items there is also horseback combat you can ride around on epona a fierce wild mare who only listens to you and shoot things with your bow and arrow there are also mini games centered around the fun and challenging horseback combat summary zelda oct is an excellent action adventure rpg with an epic story line that seamlessly melds a complex kingdom and elegant fighting style into a grand video game the characters are interesting with even the most minor sentinels having a back story that you can uncover the main story is fun to progress through and you care about a lot of the characters you meet the controls are excellent and perfectly integrated for fun non frustrating game play the bosses are challenging requiring wit to uncover their weakness from the surroundings and circumstances before you can move in and damage them with your sword final note if the 64 is too retro for you zelda oct has been remade for the gamecube with newer graphics however the gamecube controller does not integrate as seamlessly as the 64 understandably so you will miss out on a large part of what made zelda 64 great additionally there is a 3ds version but i have n't played that so i really ca n't comment
this is the best game i have ever played it has very good music grapics and the story is great!i really love this game but the only really big problem with this game is that it has this one(long and boring)temple that is very hard and(please)don't take this game lightly the bosses are hard but the story is so good that you will want to play this game again and again!but the other zelda games are lame!so only if you want to)buy this game and maybe the legend zelda a link to the past   pros the story is great it 's a fun game and the great fairys(fairys that will power you up and give you new weapons are easy to find   cons switching around the camera is a little bit hard and finding the goldskull tokens(gold coin like tokens that you win from beating spider monsters)is easy at the beginning of the game but hard at the end   this is a great game so i would recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy games i would also recommend'final fantasyi&ii dawn of souls'and'the legend of zelda the wind waker
although the final fantasy series was pretty good no other rpg can compare to this with a very long storyline and if you do n't have a strategy guide handy there 's a possibility that it might take a while to finish the game completely the features are just amazing at some points you are required to move into the future 7 years where link is a full grown adult and sometimes back 7 years to advance in your journey as an adult some things will have changed and when day turns to night and vice versa some things will change that will be different when compared to the same place only in the daytime the battles are intense and as for the boss battles the bosses have a variety of options that they can do and to effectively defend you usually have to be prepared for any quot;curves&quot that they throw at you legend of zelda oot holds a lot of replay value even after i 've finished the game i 'm still having a great time overall legend of zelda oot is probably one of the best rpgs available would be definitely worth buying and would also make a wonderful gift
this is still a great game to own especialy if you missed it but the graphics are dated   if you have a gamecube find a way to get it on there and be happy you did
this is the most absolute superior game ever made you have almost no limits as to what you can do and there is always another secret or trick you can learn not only this but there are no limits to the fun you can have with this game i enjoy the challenges and puzzles and new items and moves you have to get if you are going to buy a game for nintendo 64 this is the game to buy
this game was a tad on the easy side for the most part but it was still great fun one of the best zelda games cool places to explore and neat items to find
thinking back on the times of zelda have got me thinking the game was absolutely breath taking i remember how fun and exciting it was and it was so good because of the challenge if there is still anyone who has not played and beaten this game please get it it is totally worth the money then in 4 or 5 years you too can think of what a great game zelda was but then you will feel bad for neglecting your nintendo 64 and playing your ps2 but ps2 's time for neglection will come in a few years also
although i like the snes zelda best you really ca n't make a game better than this one   sometimes a game is made that goes above and beyond 5 stars   this game is like that a vast amount of items all found in unique ways   awesome   lots of giant evil bosses   awesome   lots of underground hidden stuff   awesome   lots of weird folk to talk to   awesome   time travel in a huge mythical world   awesome   lots of mini games to play for cool prizes   awesome   just so many awesome things packed into this one game   i usually only recommend rentals but a rental would n't do this game justice   you have to buy it you have to beat it and you have to find every secret   live this game and every now and then live it again i'll also recommend buying some kind of strategy guide or looking for tips online to find everything   i 've heard that there is a giant monsterous eel like fish in the pond but i have yet to catch anything like that
by far one of best zelda games of all time i highly recommend this game well worth the money
this is to me not only the greatest zelda game in the series but also the greatest game i 've ever play where to begin there is so much in this game that makes it so fun i absolutely love the side quests getting the biggoron sword is a race against time but very rewarding considering you will posess an awesome huge sword that is twice as powerful as the master sword!another side quest i loved was completing the gerudo training fortress to get the ice arrows this will force you to use all your skills and items and will really put you to the test i would even venture to say that the gerudo training temple is more difficult than almost every other dungeon the ghost hunting side quest is very tough and takes practice and patience capture all 10 big poes roaming the field of hyrule and sell them to the strange ghost shop you will get the 4th bottle the hardest to get)even the mask salesman side quest is very interesting and unique while many would n't bother to complete it but the reward is the very cool and mysterious mask of truth furthermore this side quest is slightly more significant considering that the masks are the focal point in the follow up majoras mask" but of course my favorite side quest is the skulltula side quest it is very long and trying but definitely worth it this is another side quest many people would n't bother to complete but completing it does have it 's merits for example there is a very profitable rewards system in play destroy 10 golden skulltulas and you get the adult wallet holds 200 rupees at 20 you get the stone of agony which when playing with a rumble pack inserted will alert the player when a secret is nearby at 30 get the giant 's wallet and you can carry 500 rupees at 40 you get bombchus i know lame at 50 get a piece of heart after that you get nothing more unless you manage to destroy all 100 golden skultullas doing this will result in you being able to get 200 rupees every time you visit the house of skultulla unlimited money is very cool although a bit useless at that late a stage in the game the bosses are great i wo n't go into great detail but i 've always loved the fight with volvagia the lava dragon there is something so classic and satisfying about watching link defeat a lava dragon in a volcano with the master sword and hylian shield also the final battle with gannondorf is a real treat and i never get tired of firing the magic arrows of light at him the fight has a very epic quality to it and the final battle against the horribly mutated gannon has a nightmarish ambience to it the temples all have thier own awesome themes both musically and environmentally i always thought that the forest temple was incredibly imaginative and just stunning it has the feel of something abandoned to the wild with overgrown vines overtaking the temple and the open courtyard the music is top notch even by today 's standards koji kondo really put together a masterpiece there is even a sweet element of sadness in link 's lost childhood with the loss of his friendship to saria the moments where shiek teaches you a song to warp to a temple always has a reference to a long lost friendship or the somewhat cruel passage of time the ability to customize adult link 's appearance is pretty unique and cool where you can choose with color tunic he wears which sword and shield to wield in short this is a wonderful game that will always have a special place in my heart
this game is one of the finest video games ever produced while its graphics may be some what dated by today 's standards its epic story and play control are arguably better than many of today 's titles i can not recommend this game enough
the legend of zelda ocarina of time is the greatest game in the entire legend of zelda video game series   period 'nuff said
awesome storyline awesome graphics perfect game great challenge but not too challenging that you ca nt beat it thanx nintendo for the greateast game ever made great game for all ages highly recommended
this is the best n64 r.i.p. game i have ever played it 's full of vast 3d worlds cool characters and has a deep storyline the worlds are huge take hyrule field a place which has absolutely nothing to do with the story but going there to get new places is soooo much fun when you are n't doing anything and are just playing around you can have hours of fun running around hunting skullkids and running from those flying spikey flower thingies when you 're an adult you can hunt poes ghosts in the field and get rewards and stuff for it anyway the story is about a boy named link who is destined to save his home world hyrule from a powerful wizard the wizard wants to get ahold of the triforce an ancient artifact which has the power to alter the world he does and changes the world to a hell link then has to go through many dungeons and meet many people and eventully save his land of hyrule and return peace that 's about it peace
everything a video game is supposed to be lots visually diverse landscapes and effects intriguing gameplay and endless oppotunities for exploration within the framework of the game no boring moments here the horse is certainly a nice touch being a bit of a horse fanatic myself provides a fairly lifelike representation of horse riding nice soundtrack and the interactive music play was quite satisfying all in all a well designed game wish they were all this good
zelda ocarina of time is a well made game that perfectly blends battle sequences and puzzles   the battles which can only be won using the right method against the right enemy are simplified by z targeting which aims all attacks at the enemy   it takes a long time to beat months as any good rpg role playing game should   unfortunately it constantly and inevitably reminds you of the controls although they 're pretty easy in messages which you usually must read   i suggest this for all people especially those that enjoy a good challenge
i got this game because every person said it was the best game ever for 1998 it is but now it 's just good not as good as wind waker or twilight princess the level design is good parts are 3d others are resident evil camera in short it works okay but i screwed up many times becaus of it the graphics were good several years ago but now they are muddy and polygonal aside from that it 's zelda nothing new if you buy it do n't expect it to live up to all the hype
there always comes along trend setters that some how can not be bettered zelda is one of those games its challenging enjoyable adventurous fun i loved every minute of it even though at times i wanted root out my hair i have no regrets having this game in my collection one of the best games ever on 64.even though the 64 era has ended if you are a die hard gamer from time to time you may want to go back this game is definitely worth playing again and again there 's always something you would have miss that you can find the next time around
this title might be the best game ever the best title for the n64 it is beyond any doubts.- graphics i have n't played much n64 but for all i know this is the best you can get in the plataform beautiful enviroment landscapes well designed characters different places and detailed textures for this plataform the graphics are hot i mean it and you did n't even need graphics this game would be great even without them this game will be forever known because it has changed the world of games with such 3d graphics plus the lock on camera this game will be forever reminded because of that approved graphics.- sound this game has the best soundtrack ever if you ask me ... nearly every song in this game wins a 10/10 score i really want to find a soundtrack for this game because both the ocarina songs and the in game songs are awesome characters do n't have voices except when they scream when they 're scared and this kind of thing so the voice acting is n't great but the sound wins a 9/10 because of the nearly perfect soundtrack.- fun this game touches you with a great story great characters great songs you really feel as if you were link in the beautiful land of hyrule and that makes the game so good that you ca n't say it 's not fun when you feel like the character you just ca n't stop playing even in the boring parts in other words the water and fire temples the different times you play and the many secrets hidden i mean it many secrets i highly doubt you can get them all makes the game even greater even more perfect.- educative i really do n't know why this game is rated e for everyone ... i feel like the game has some scary parts in other words the cemitery and the shadow temple so it should be rated t for teen even though it has no great violence no red blood just green blood sometimes but you parents should n't worry about that this beauty must be taken to your children overall there 's nothing to say i do n't know what you 're doing reading my review if you have n't played this game yet this is one of those games you must beat during your lifetime the wind waker the last game in the series is very good but it is n't nearly as good as ocarina of time it might take a long time for you to beat it if you 're always busy because the game is not short but you must try it 'll be an unforgettable experience to be link in hyrule
when the nintendo 64 was first introduced to the public in 1996 the game super mario 64 revolutionized the gaming industry with the introduction of 3-d gaming   however it was n't until two years later that nintendo really perfected the 3-d adventure genre with the release of the legend of zelda ocarina of time" "ocarina is for lack of a better word a nearly perfect game in almost every sense   the graphics are great for n64 standards the music is fantastic the gameplay is smooth and the story is incredibly engaging   much like the mario franchise before it the zelda franchise although already somewhat established on the nes and snes took a simple character mario to zelda put him in an interesting environment mushroom kingdom to hyrule and pits him against fantastic enemies of course perhaps the true greatness of ocarina is its balance between the essential gameplay and the sidequests   while this game added more depth riding a horse getting items that while not vital to the outcome of the game will help you etc than any previous game in history it also was n't too complicated see donkey kong 64   in the game link has a straight forward mission and accomplishes each objective in sequence ... you only need to pursue the frivolous things if you so desire the quirkiness of the game is also charming   along the way link meets a talking tree gets trapped inside a fish 's belly befriends the roly poly gorons and liberates temples that each correspond to some sort of natural theme forest ice water fire etc   the first time i ever played ocarina and every time since i found myself amazed by the crazy and colorful characters that nintendo came up with for each area of the game finally a great adventure games also needs to have an intriguing plot i.e. the reason why the myst computer game series was such a big success while its clones failed which ocarina delivers superbly   right away you are drawn into the storyline that includes rescuing princess zelda defeating the evil gannondorf and bring peace to hyrule again   i know it may sound cheesy but without an engaging plot the game would have been little more than a sword slashing rpg with a few puzzles thrown in thus i recommend ocarina of time to all gamers whether young or old beginners or experts   the difficulty curve is set as such that you will be able to steadily improve your skills in time to defeat each obstacle before you while enough really challenging side quests exist that you can also hone your skills to a tee if so desired   so whether you want to fire up the old n64 dust off the old gamecube for which a version of ocarina was released or buy the game on the virtual console of your wii do so with confidence that you will instantly be charmed by this amazing work of video game creation
ok alot of people hate this game but i ca nt complain with it although some of the levels are annoying i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion at least it held mostly to the name of tomb raider the 2nd and 4th onwards should be named city raider the graphics are kinda yellowish the lighting can be harsh but its a lengthy game took me almost 6months to beat partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game its better than the 2nd and way better than all the others afterwards but does nt messure up to the original
lara croft games have never been any good   i remember when the very first one came out 10 years ago   teens were practically drooling on their controller every time they saw lara 's pretty face   tomb raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin market   the thing is the games are boring and lara croft is n't very pretty if polygon breasted girls are your thing go for it   but they are n't my thing and i know i 'm not the only one to think so   lara croft is n't good looking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blocky looking computer babe is n't going to automatically make a game any fun to play   i 'll give lara croft some credit   she was one of the originators of the running around half naked female shooter adventure type of video games   in fact you might even say she was a major influence because soon after her very first adventure more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games half naked chicks   lara brought something new to the world of video games and i will give her credit for that sometimes influence does n't matter when a game is really bad   this is one of those cases   the tomb raider series on the original playstation is a joke   i absolutely groan when i think about playing a tomb raider game because i remember how ugly and dark the environments are the glitchy problems that dominate all three tomb raider games the annoying and difficult jumping style of lara croft which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game   good luck- she never jumps where you want her to and of course mentioned above lara 's supposed beautiful face she 's not pretty remember?)it also does n't help that the puzzles you have to solve are always really awful and appear frequently and because of the jumping problem very frustrating to complete   trying to aim your gun at an emeny is n't exactly a walk in the park either   the whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this point by the time tomb raider 3 was released people were really getting fed up with the series   now these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more tomb raider games but i actually think people got sick of tomb raider because games like resident evil and silent hill came along with a similar style and improved on it drastically making tomb raider look awfully dated by comparison at least the third tomb raider game has some decent looking background levels   i guess the company who created lara croft finally understood that lara 's pretty face alone is n't going to get the job done anymore   i mean at least in some places the backgrounds look good   not exactly the prettiest environments available on the playstation of course and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight   but what 's there is okay to look at at least tomb raider 3 features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the above mentioned jumping problem   she simply does n't jump the way you want her to   you 'd think the game company would 've dealt with this problem with all the new moves for lara they added to the game but no none of these new moves make the game any easier   the artifact finding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it boy am i glad i never bought any of these games all these years i 've been watching other people play them   reading reviews for the more recent tomb raider games on the playstation 2 i see no improvements have been made   let the series end already
it 's not that this game is bad it 's just too hard the levels consist of timed events e.g. flip a switch and run to the other end of the level before a door closes the graphics are good as is the music the story is non existent though something about aliens and it includes one of the worst and shortest endings in all of video game history it 's fun yet frustrating graphics 8/10sound 7/10control 7/10fun 4/10
i own a playstation but i hardly think it 's that great a console blame it on the n64 for their exceptional games- but i do believe that the playstation may have some hope left in it well tomb raider 3 is a good   example this is a huge game with a lot of 3d explosions and gunfire and   lots of jumping also if you have something against people and animals   then you wo n't be dissappointed either you also get to blow uo raptors   and a t rex by the way despite being a solid title i beta the game long   ago and have since went on to other pursuits like zelda i 'm not gon na   compare the two mind you but let 's say that while tl3 is a really good   game and somewhat long- it 's not gon na make a classic or give mario or   sonic a run for their money simply put all the tr games are long and   filled with adventure lara 's cute and i like this game but it 's just not   gon na be what i 'm looking for long term it 's also tedious to have to   play through it again i think it 's a mood game you 're likely to bore   through the whole thing when you 're in the mood and that sounds   extreme but as you can tell 4 stars is saying alot cause this game   definetely restores my faith in the playstation and it 's over rated games if lara were to make the jump to the dolphin- i would n't be surprised   tomb raider always had the potential to be a great game it 's just that   sometimes- you need a lot of patience and perhaps this will fit   nicely finally the graphics and the sound are passable levels are   detailed but heavily pixelated and sound sounds cranky or too soft at   times but given any new lara croft game i 'll be excited and i 'm looking   foward to the new game after the last one last christmas
yes tr3 is a bear so to speak ;-)   e.g. there 's a particular spot at the very outset of the game hiding under the leaves which you have to make a blind leap to find and would never guess is there if someone had n't told you   but that is in the grand old tradition of adventure -- the one point remainder a postage stamp usually in the old days or dropping the magazine in a particular place when you 're at your wit 's end   the impossible puzzle drags you out of the game and forces you to kickstart your social life and ask real people for the answer   very legitimate   same as do n't kill monks at barkhang monastery tr2 and do n't kill monkeys either tr3   this game is a heckuva lot of fun on a great many levels other than gameplay   it 's full of visual splendors that rival the next to last discontinuous maze of tr2 and i enjoy everything about it ... except playing   the game part is tedious unfair and annoying beyond belief   but it 's a real collector 's item especially on playstation 2 be sure to keep your ps1 memory card and in our family it 's in its second generation of total immersion
tomb raider is a great series but has always had some flaws no difference here in this game you start out in india or something then you have a choice between nevada london or some other rainforest you end up doing them all eventually but you pick the order you then finish up by going to antarctica the story line is something like lara is trying to find a meteor or something that killed everybody along time ago or something like that the controls are very shaky but after a while you get used to them the best part of the game is deffinately her house this is the training level if you want tips on how to skip levels and get the key in her house to the four wheeler e mail me at lazyboy112@adelphia.net i have a bunch of codes if you 're a fan df lara and tomb raider get it but if you 're not than do n't waste your money

tomb raider 3 was by far the most difficult tomb raider i have ever played i 'll admit i used every cheat in the book in order to beat the game but can you really blame me?the game first starts off with an incredibly difficult jungle level in which you have the option of finding a few secrets and then beginning the level but regardless you 'll be jumping to a slope and then jumping over a set of spikes and then surprise jumping over another set of spikes and finally landing at the bottom with a save crystal and a bunch of different directions to go do n't go into the sinking sand and watch out for anything that looks dangerous because chances are it 'll be the last dangerous think you look at finally after a period of a week to a year you 've finally beat the jungle levels ... without cheats well i bet you were quite tempted now choose your destination the strategy guides all tell you to go to the nevada desert and then to the south pacific and then london if you watch the entire story so far ... &quot feature you 'll notice that the game plays the scenes with south pacific first and nevada desert last so nobody cares what order you do it in it does n't matter much and believe me you will get frustrated either way so go to the one you want to go to first because it will take you forever to finish that section of levels finally after god knows how long you finished the whole globe and get this you did it all without cheat codes i congratulate you now we get to go to antartica!!!yippee antarctica is incredibly difficult and it ends with a big mumbo jumbo mother of all spiders human headed thing oh and one shot with the rocket launcher just wo n't kill it and one thing to keep on mind one hit k.o. as in if it hits you once it will kill you good luck!but in spite of all of that i really enjoyed seeing lara in new costumes and playing in her new house it was a lot of fun to get the racetrack key and find the shortcut at the racetrack i must say i really did enjoy tomb raider 3.if you like challenges then tomb raider 3 is definitely for you and regardless the mansion is definitely worth the 5 dollars that tomb raider 3 now cost at game crazy but if you 're anything like me and do not enjoy getting so frustrated over a horribly pixilated british woman in a jungle tomb then get ready to memorize quot;l2 r2 l2(2 r2 l2 r2 l2 r2 l2(4 r2 l2 r2(4 l2&quot if you want to beat this game
i love the tomb raider series except for this one it 's way to hard and it wo n't let you save unless you find a save crystle after that i switched to the pc vesion which has unlimited saves but there is only one problem ... it 's to old for windows xp!!so buy at own risk but if you want to play it and you have an old computer i recommend the pc version
for a few reasons new people of the tomb raider games should not start out on this one unless they are really skilled at video games seriously i beat tomb raider one and two and even four with a heck of a lot more ease than i did with part three so no i would not recommend this to new gamers but people that want a challenge this is the game to get one of the biggest reasons this game is so hard are the secrets they sometimes put the secrets in places you would never even notice so i advise if you want the secret level at the end of this game to get a strategy guide cause 99 of the time you can not find all the secrets on your own the secret level though is not neccessary to beat the game at the end and not truly worth the bother to me i was so happy and exhausted to just finally beat the game that i could have cared less about a secret level and would n't have wanted to play it anyway and that was another problem how hard the ultimate boss at the end was i thought the dragon in part two was difficult- at least when it hit me i did n't automatically lose with the ultimate boss in part three if you get too close he will spew this stuff at you and right away you drop dead it was difficult and frustrating and took me forever to beat yet i can not say it is impossible for i did at last beat it but it is nearly impossible and will take you most likely a long while like i. what i did was the best i got out my rocket launcher and just kept blowing away at him while jumping around and around that platform i definitely would not stand there or get too close make sure you are as far away as possible for he will not spew that stuff at you unless you are close then i guess the next hardest part of part three was just the levels themselves some parts of the game were very difficult and without the strategy guide next to me i would have encountered many many dead ends or stepped into a place that just ended lara it grew pretty frustrating at times and the worst part of it all is that you can not save anytime you like- so unless you cheat and get a load of crystals you will do some backtracking worst part of the game nevada- in this part all the medi packs you saved up all the ammo you saved up before- the guards take it all away from you so you have to go through the levels finding your guns and picking up as many medi packs as you can it grew to be very difficult and i hated that part of the game the only good part of this level was at the very end when you got to see a few alien bodies best parts of the game south america- for its lovely scenes and it was n't impossible to beat i also liked the dinosaurs they put in it reminded me of tomb raider one all over again and london- london was fun as well i enjoyed playing there with what looked like the same sphinx- like statue placed in this part as was in tomb raider one except this time you do n't go into this one so- so levels india- sometimes a challenge that got on my nerves but then the rest of the time it was just normal tomb raider stuff a little boring of a level compared to the others the statues coming alive were pretty scary though anartica- creepy part of the game at the ending part of all tomb raider games there is some breed of creatures you have to fight- in part one it was what looked like animals turned inside out- in part two she fought what looked like action figures- and now in part three she has to fight mutants creepy definitely got a little scary sometimes and this part of the game was not too hard but indeed i was always kept on alert with those mutants one problem i hated in this part though was the carts- those mine carts drove me crazy i was always dying in them just keep working at it though eventually you get around those corners without dying overall i give this game a 3.5 to a 4 star rating it is definitely not as good as the first two just a heck of a lot more frustrating but indeed it was a challenge and lara croft is still a fun character to play with so i ca n't hate this game but i definitely will not play it again for a long time it is just too stressful and hard of a game to play all the time do not think tomb raider four is just as stressful and nearly impossible- part four is a lot better and i recommend it highly
never played this when i was a kid but decided to purchase a classic game as i 'm trying to build my own personal ps1 collection
the second one was the best in the series for me still this was a good flick and many others just went off the deep end   the newest one is by far the best in the series and a complete re invention
you run around look for extremely hard to find switches and wander some more then well you know look for switches and well you then its ummmmm wander some more.then somewhere in the midst of all this maddening insanity a cool monster will jump out and you get to waste his butt with a dynamite lased arrow.then its back to the wandering
turok 2 seeds of evil is the sequel to turok dinosaur hunter that not only surpasses that game in it 's greatness but is my most favorite game in the series of four games that came out on the n64 everything that made the original such a great game to play was improved upon especially in the way of graphics with the expansion pak graphics had almost a playstation 2 quality to them it 's something that showed with this game it showed in the textures of the environments the details of the architecture lighting effects and other eye candy the game was also bigger and better than any other game with the exception of zelda ocarina of time in it 's 32 meg cartridge as you 've probably read in the courtesy review it 's been stated to have over 45 hours of playtime while i do n't know about that personally as i had n't checked where i stand within the game .. one thing i do know is it 's one lengthy meaty game to sink your teeth(playtime into while turok 2 seeds of evil stood in the shadow of rare 's goldeneye during it 's release turok 2 still stands the test of time in terms of gameplay and is one game every nintendo fan should add to their collection if not for the fact that it had a killer storyline and an awesome arsenal of weapons to play with then for the fact it was an absolute beauty of a game
this game is fun the visuals are impressive and the guns are frickin cool and some fun multi player play this game because you deserve something special unless you re a dragon ball z fan
if you like the story then get this for me multiplayer is where it counts and i have more fun with rage wars frag tag is awesome
anyone who likes 007 would enjoy this game great first person shooter i will enjoy playing this game the game play is a bit strange and hard to get use to because the aim and movement joysticks should be switched the c pad on the n64 controller is hard to move with great game with practice
turok 2 when i was younger as a kid was amazing no parents told me i was not aloud to play it because they never actually played it themselves to know the graphical content and gore was stunning to my 5 year old eyes the first level took me forever to beat and i only beat it once plus i did n't have a controller pak then came the day i bought it again for my n64 nothing looks more sexy than turok 2 in a green nintendo 64 the first time i ever beat it and it took as long as it did to beat a metroid game and there are only 6 levels weapons in old games to begin with were always amazing i was always able to hold as many as they would let me such as doom turok south park armorines perfect dark etc then new games came along and ruined everything that is great about fps sure they have better graphics and frame rate but they are all the same to be honest emulators sucks ass i do n't care if its rgb or not but just old games from dos to the beginning game cube fps 's are all i got but something about the way a n64 looks and the way the graphics look on it just make me love it so much to me it 's the best looking system and has the best looking games turok tops it all way ahead of its time it set the standard of what the n64 was capable of turok 2 is on pc and n64 the n64 game had stencil bits and made the game take a hit in frame rate stencil bit shadows were a new thing in 98 so iguana tried it out in my honest opinion i would n't have even cared if the shadows were just the classic circle or just no shadows at all still it is stunning the n64 could handle what was thrown at it the ai in the game was the most fascinating thing i have ever seen in a game and still is they are smart and fight one another really fun to watch i found the game to run best in hi res lb and looks the best as well the weapons are still the coolest weapons in any game on the face of this planet and all of them are uniquely different my favorite weapons are the tek bow shotgun war blade razor wind cerebral bore plasma rifle mag-60 grenade launcher the kick ass charge rifle one of the best looking weapons firestorm cannon like a mini gun but different and bad ass sounding nuke flamethrower the first fire to actually show 3d even in almost all games on n64 and the torpedo launcher because you can go through water faster music has always been one of my favorite things when it comes to games because the music sets the mood and turok 2 has the best music in any n64 game i have ever heard sorry perfect dark your music and k7-avenger are great to but turok is to bad ass iguana seemed to like it so much and acclaim that that the music is in all turok games as well as vexx and armorines and more have some similar sound the multiplayer in turok 2 to me is absolutely stunning i run that in low res and is just as good as goldeneye perfect dark the world is not enough and turok rage wars quite a few games ran on the turok engine as well armorines a amazing game uniquely different yet just as awesome and south park not many liked this game but to me it 's like a mixture of doom+turok south park ... the multiplayer is good to just do n't go above 2 players so you see turok 2 was used in many things and is an amazing game once you play it you will wish iguana and acclaim still existed they were the company that developed and distributed games with their say so making their games unique most hated their games but they never looked at the work they did extreme g2 for example had so much done to it that it to suffered frame rate and certain levels were unplayable in single player grand prix but in time trials they all ran smooth and helped with remembering everything extreme g2 to me is the best out of the series i have almost every game by acclaim and love every game except turok 3 its a good run the first time but compared to dinosaur hunter and seeds of evil it is crap so turok 2 is amazing if you want to try it get it now on n64 or even on pc you will love the game and see all the death animations and creative designs and levels turok is the greatest fps try them all your own risk for 3 but a good to the collection dinosaur hunter 1 amazing smooth game great n64 game the first fps on n64 seeds of evil 2 worthy sequel and is amazing in graphics and game play shadow of oblivion a okay game for the first run but great for the collection rage wars the true sequel or attachment to turok 2 and has great multiplayer and just as bad ass guns evolution fantastic remake of the first turok starring tal'set and has amazing weapons and is the biggest game of them all featuring over 14 chapters and has awesome multiplayer turok pc,360,ps3 i played it on 360 runs on the unreal engine which is bad ass a great game with good weapons why i liked it is because i was quick and accurate i run faster than slow ass call of duty and has worthy death animations like turok 2 but not as good and not as good music awesome multiplayer if anyone is on and a good campaign these are the turok games which started out as comics and became life and were playable get turok 2 you will enjoy it and bring a few friends over it is a true turok game and is worth being played even in todays cliche fps trigger happy cod fans
this game 's graphics and animations are very well done and the story line is above average   the thing that in my opinion makes it average is how long the levels are coupled with the ridiculous death throes more on the later   it reminds me of the days of jaws and friday the 13th games for the nes where the levels dragged on and on and on .... each level in this game will take you at least three hours to get thru and not only that but you ll have to back track thru old levels to get new keys and items etc   after a while it gets to the point where you get tired of it and quit   and one more thing this game seems to have been made for a bored teenage kid or adolescent there are no puzzles or challenges to keep you intrigued except for the occasional switch to find and that gets boring the game is basically just kill this dinosaur and watch the blood spew forth while it goes thru a ridiculous death throe considering how long the levels are use the cheats some have mentioned and you should get a lot more enjoyment out of it at least that way you wo nt have to be backtracking all the time   buy this game used
love this game   so much fun   it is even better with the cheats   one of the best games for the n64   i can play this for hours apon hours   i love this game
this is a great game if you are prepared to accept that this game really was n't meant for the n64 the game has numerous slowdowns even if you have an expansion pak on the n64 not everywhere but anytime there are a bunch of explosions or a whole horde of enemies are following you then you will have some sorta slowdown now onto all the pros of this game i witnessed this game before i played it my friends were playing it when i was like 11 or so and this game scared me to death i thought reptoids and endtrails were the scariest monsters ever capturing children not knowing what they were going to to do to them this game saids its rated m but you really should play this when you are a kid it 's a whole lot scarier when you 're a kid not so much when you 're an adult either way this game gives off a very unsettling atmosphere if you want a mindless shooter like the original turok this game is not for you the antagonists actually have a story this time the enemy ai is very realistic the monsters react with the precise speed and vitriol that makes sense the graphics were probably the best graphics on the n64 again the n64 version has slowdowns but at the time these were the best graphics we 've ever seen in a video game and i still quite beautiful in retrospect this game also have a variety of very orginally designed monsters the raptors and purrlin are still here but they are way cooler and better equiped this time you fight genetical engineered dinosoids zombies purrlin big apelike creatures insects spiders cave dwellers the blind ones worms a fat bitch that comes near the end and even robots all look bad ass looking and ready to kill you the death animations are some of the best death animations ever made in the history of video games in this game you litteral can blow someones head off or a limb or a whole torso the weapon choice is also top notch i 'm sorry but the cereberal bore was the coolest weapon ever thought of that 's just my opinion there 's just nothing better than locking onto an enemies head shooting a bore the bore drains the cereberal fluid and then explodes when it reaches the center coolest weapon ever made the razorwind is also cheap as hell i really can go on and on about how good this game is this is probably my favorite fps next todoom both which are tied for first
after playing turok the dinosaur hunter for ten minutes i realized i had a great game at hand it was like mortal kombat except in a shooting game blood everywhere amazing enemies and weapons and a good good time and i 'll admit this i do n't actully play the turok games no i 'm sorry i do n't it 's not that their hard or boring but i do n't play them ... well not without the cheats at least as soon as i find out a new turok game 's coming i get on the internet go to happypuppy.com and find the master cheat yeah it 's pretty low but it 's fun to go in these blood soaked shooter games and the second one is no exception i played this game without cheats for a few hours made up my mind and decided it was great and would be even better with cheats half an hour later i came back with the master cheat in my hand which is bewareoblivionisathand or if you break it down beware oblivion is at hand within minutes i had an amazing arsenal all maps invincibility and more by my side the weapons ... well let 's just say the first turok ca n't touch them you have the usual knife and bow and arrow pistol shotgun and the rest but you now also have a nuke pod layer which lays bombs on the ground and they explode on contact a machine gun as the first had but this one 's much better the cerebrial bore the most gory weapon of all it launches out a little ball and it goes straight for the enemies head when it gets there it starts sucking and draining blood form their head then after 5 second it explodes and takes the enemies head with it my personal favorite the razor wind a shield with sharp edges on it you throw it and it cuts up all enemies in it 's path then come right back to you it can chop off just about any limb you throw it at the head the legs and the arms and another physical weapon the war blade the name says it all overall this game is a vast improvement and is the best yet but that might change as soon as i play evolution the graphics are great awesome story vast detailed enviroments and some hot blue chick that always pops up what more could you ask for
the biggest grip that i had was the controls   they just did n't feel right and i got killed more often then not just trying to walk or jump   alltogether a decent game though
turok 2 seeds of evil has a lot to love about it   the music rocks   the graphics are still quite good for n64 standards especially if you have the expansion pak   it controls just fine get used to the c button controls   there 's some good multiplayer   it 's a bloody gory mess   and the weapons are freaking awesome just wait till you see the cerebral bore).but there 's a big problem with it designi'm not talking about the art direction or graphical look   turok 2 is still a good looking game with gruesome enemies and solid lighting effects   but these levels are confusing as all hell with the exception of the 1st one   if we had a better story to go along with it then maybe there 'd be a reason to plow through   but for whatever reason acclaim iguana decided to force the player to scour every inch of the 6 levels and if you 're stuck you 're stuck for good you will be required to light beacons find keys and rescue children   again level 1 is n't so bad but levels 2 6 are gon na be a pain in the butt if you get lost   the map you 're given sucks   and to make matters worse you ca n't leave or quit levels once you 've selected them but if you 're not too proud to grab a strategy guide or go online then turok 2 will be more fun than perhaps some of us had back in 2000   the combat is still a blast although the final primegen boss is impossible without cheat codes   the presentation is sharp   and the turok world is still very unique from today 's overload of military war shooters "turok 2 was one of the n64 's most critically acclaimed titles for the console rightfully so   but be warned it 'll test your gaming logic more than you expect
when i heard about turok 2 comming out i was so friggin phyced!i was nt dissapointed it was even bettter than the first   it wasa little sci fi for me though   and what was up with turok ... he looked so young   i really did nt get the story   if you get the cheats its even better   even more awsome weapons for you touse   you kick alien ass and take names!this is one of my favorite sequals for a video game its very original   the game is frustrating without cheats butits really fun and cool   its pretty much as violent as thefirst one i love this game!great graphicsgreat gameplaygreat story .... kina confused with turok bein youngover allits a great game!way to go acclaim
twisted metal 3 is overrated because it 's not normally considered the worst playstation game   i ca n't believe how unfun this game is   the   control is laughable   the gameplay is incredibly boring   the music is rob   zombie which is bad enough before you hear it 5,000 times in a row   the   game also adds almost nothing new   do n't even rent this one
no idea to say about that have same with twisted metal 2 4 and twisted metal small brawl i have n't play for long time
in 1998 twisted metal 3 was released for ps1 the sequel to 1996 's twisted metal 2 and the original twisted metal released in 1995 a new developer 989 studios took over for singletrac who developed the first games in the series this game uses a entirely new engine built from the ground up since it was a new developer working with the series i have personally played this game and will say that its garbage and not even worth being mentioned as apart of tm series the cars control bad plus the graphics look realistic like the first game rather than cartoonish like the second game its basically the same as tm2 where you travel around the world to places like tokyo london area 51 egypt hollywood just to name a few levels a few characters from the previous games are in the game like darkside hammerhead sweet tooth thumper outlaw mr grim specter warthog minion as well as new characters the endings for the characters are really cheesy unlike tm2 which was pretty dark the game also allows you to hook up a multi tap to play with four other friends well three but four if you include yourself
i believe that any twisted metal game you purchase will be fun and exiting because the fundamentals are the same throughout all the games seek out enemy kill and move to the next level and the cool thing is you are using cars to blow things up and getting to destroy others also the levels are locations that we all reconciles so that adds to the fun i like twisted metal 3 because they brought more of a 3d look to cheaters locations car weapons and added new cheaters to the story as well as embellish on the story line yes the graphics are not all out there however the game play is the same and for the most part is stood true to the twisted metal franchise that was created in the beginning if you love twisted meat at all you will love this one i have played all twisted metal games and for the most part i do like them all and this one i really do like very much
the main reason that people hate this game is because it came right after twisted metal 2 and people were expecting a lot of improvement but the expectations were in vain the game is n't all that bad i mean ... mr. grimm still cool there is a new viper car you can use rain missiles as weapons some of the characters and stories are very funny the graphics were improved the rob zombie intro song was awesome and the london spaceship and blimp stages were great.now the reason that this game suck 's is because everything in the game looks like fake plastic the special effects are not shocking at all you ca n't make any massive explosion or massive destruction many characters look lame if your car turns upside down you have to wait for 5 seconds for your car to stand up and many stages are very small p.s this twisted metal sequel is terrible but at least is not garbage as twisted metal 4 that game was n't even a twisted metal game that was more like the circus war x(adios
thank you for having this game and in its good conditionyou have increased my collection of games by one
this game was alright but definately had more flaws the other tm 's are way better than this one but this one was nt that bad it was good
it 's decent but probably the worst in the series the level design is very poor and i dislike most of the characters i 'd recommend any other twisted metal besides this one
this game is not receiving the credit it deserves it 's a good quality game i had a blast playing it far more than i did with twisted metal 1 and 2 the whole series is awesome and to me there s not a bad twisted metal game
how can anyone not like this game i do n't know about you guys but i still like to play this as weel as twisted metal 2 even though i just got an 360 i will still play this whenever
as most already know twisted metal is a car combat game collect weapons and destroy your enemies as you drive pretty simple idea that can definitely be fun .... summary:(read below if you wanted more info)1= very good2 great!3= hit or miss with the more realistic physics4= hit or miss imo due to the character design styled more like 1 2 than 3black first and best ps2 twisted metal arguably the best twisted metal of allhead on good gameplay online mode included psp and ps2 spiritual sequel to twisted metal 2twisted metal 2012 for ps3)=didnt play this one but heard it was goodtwisted metal a great game revolutionary for video games of the first 3d era still a fun game and the only twisted metal with the inside the car view no saving to memory cards there was a short code for resuming your game later twisted metal 2 most fans will consider this to be the best twisted metal of all the final release with single track after this one the game changes its physics dramatically ... twisted metal 3 in this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars now this is n't necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just was n't as fun this was 989 studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like 3 the best however a few of the early twisted metal fans like 3 better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all   in the end 989 failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiral twisted metal 4 this game still made by 989 studios and after twisted metal 3 alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun   i would say compared to 1 and 2 the default characters you can chose from are less interesting and useful however you can create your own cars   i think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal 4 if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game   this game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was   this is the last twisted metal game for the playstation 1.twisted metal black first playstation 2 release and back in the hands of the original creators who reformed under the name incognito entertainment   best graphics easily so far and better than even the game to come after and gameplay that s arguably just or good or better than any of the other games   with nearly as many features as 4 including the first twisted metal game that was online capable(with a special disc not all copies could do that and official servers are shut down now   this game is considered the best by playstation 2 fans and many fans of the twisted metal series twisted metal head on this is the spirtual sequel to twisted metal 2 its graphics and gameplay feel like they derived from number 2 however i would not say gameplay is quite as good as number 2 it does have all new stages and solid gameplay with new upgrade system after you kill an opponent you can collect a drop from them to increase your fire power this could be considered better or worse
having played the twisted metal series for a few years now i can honestly say that twisted metal iii while having an initial gleam at first play it wears itself out fairly quickly the gleam i 'm speaking of is the slick graphics and the incredibly different game play it tries to be something new which it is but it improves in all the wrong ways allow me to explain weapons inventory instead of a max capacity of the total number of weapons in your inventory you are limited to how many of each weapon you can have for example i can pick up 10 homing missiles but no more the rest of my inventory has to be stocked with other useless weapons like speed missiles more on that in a bit in previous tm installments you could keep building your homing missile capacity and carry only those as long as you did n't exceed the max capacity annoying new weapons okay so initially i thought the rain missile was the best thing since sliced bread but really the rain missile does n't do very much apart from visual appeal the missile shoots into the air and you detonate it and a ring of fire falls down like five mini napalms it does n't do the damage the napalm does but only allows the cars to drive through so they start on fire ... at least until they turbo stop drop and roll in tm maneuvers out of it 2 seconds later minimal damage done the introduction of the speed missile was the worst mistake of the weapon category it 's a fast missile that has the strength of three machine gun bullets if you can fire them fast you can do some damage but they 're so useless during combat that it really does n't even matter.(((remotes are plenty but do much less damage than in tm2 freeze missiles the left right up maneuver do not hit enemies like they used to it is much harder to freeze an enemy this can be frustrating enemies new characters are added some are great some not so great your enemies now have the a.i. that allows them to steal items from in front of you if they need health they will race you for it and take the health this is especially frustrating when you are fighting minion and you have one shot left to kill him and he quickly finds full health cue controller hitting floor*the levels are not very large not much scenery and not much to discover there 's a few hidden places you can find to explore but for the most part it 's very limited all in all tm3 falls flat the previous installments are much better both in game play value and in overall playability if you can find this cheap get it otherwise pass it up
twisted metal one was good two was awesome but now three is n't very good sure there are new people and new levels but it 's not any better if you like the series then get this if you 're not a fan rent it
trust me do not buy this game   i am the local tm lover and know all   i bought tm4 tm2 and tm3 sadly i ca n't find a copy of tm1   after i bought tm2 i was looking forward to cool characters cool battlegrounds and semi pixated graphics   i found none of these things   there are only 4 new characters club kid auger flamethrower and my favorite new driver flower power   the levels especially washington dc is a small open level which is no fun   the north pole is annoying and i hate the boring london level   the graphics are cheesy and 989 studios tried to make them look too real   the cars flip over with every tight turn you make when another car hits you or you drive onto a hill   this game is not realistic   this game should have 0 stars and is a disgrace to the tm title   i warn you do not even look at this game   it is the worst   the car combat genre is in shame
a lot of people dismiss this game because of the different developers but i personally thought it was a good game   it was the first twisted metal i have played and when i played twisted metal 2 i thought it was a little better but not much
if you 're a collector then go for it if not then this game is just more of the same   it 's still ok though
works just fine old school just the way it should be a huge improvement from twisted metal ii   still old school graphics but it still is fun to play
although i should probably first say the disc its self was in perfect condition i was not satisfied   the picture led me to believe i would get the game disc case and manual   all i received was the disc   maybe i assumed to much and should have read the description better but the picture its self was misleading   read the fine print with this seller
if you 've made it to this point in your life without playing a twisted metal game that 's all right we 'll explain it to you the trilogy is probably best described as a vehicular version of midway 's mortal kombat or else a james cameron 's terminator take on a demolition derby in it a horde of over the top characters compete against each other in cars and trucks armed with missiles freeze rays and other assorted weapons of destruction this time out there are a few new cars and weapons and you have an option to have a computer controlled ally aide you in the tournament though he always seems to be the first one blown up in the fight the biggest change to the series though is that its developer has changed from singletrac who 've started a new but like minded auto combat series under the moniker rogue trip for gt interactive to 989 studios a sony owned development studio this affects the game on nearly every level graphically the game appears much differently from the previous titles in the line though it 's not necessarily improved there are various shading and lighting effects at work but the end result is somehow grainy and washed out the title 's soundtrack which is comprised of songs by rob zombie and pitch shifter is very fitting but the supporting sound effects are very weak for example the machine gun sounds like a cap pistol and driving through water inexplicably sounds pretty similar to that the game 's much touted new physics engine turns out pretty strange in function the cars will now dip and roll upon collision which sounds fantastic in theory but in practice is fairly questionable since vehicles will often flip over after hitting a small curb or even a snowman the collision detection is also highly suspect as instances where you 'll find yourself stuck on a ledge or halfway into a wall are frequent it 's very nice to have analog control this time but the physics engine really works against it the main downfall of twisted metal iii though is its lackluster level design most of the stages are if not modeled after extremely reminiscent of levels from the first two games and those that are n't are even more uninspired the washington level for instance is a long rectangular courtyard with a ramped area on one end and teleportation sphere which sends vehicles to the ramped area on the other snore in the two player modes the default horizontal split screen runs into the same problem found in singletrac 's rogue trip since the levels are no longer as flat as in the previous tm games having half you horizon cut away makes it hard to see in hilly or ramp heavy levels fortunately the designers had the foresight to include a wide variety of split screen perspectives such as a vertical cut and variations on a four way split where the other two boxes are filled with radar speedometer and weapons info these are the best since you view the world through a smaller version of the full screen in the three- and four player modes the perspective is similarly cornered both appear to cut into the frame rate and increase the visible seams between surfaces but not majorly multiple views aside though the game is as much fun in multiplayer mode as it is in single player as there you 'll be struck with the feelings of quot;why am i here?&quot and quot;why am i playing this&quot after a level or two there are a few good ideas at work within twisted metal iii such as the multiple perspectives but they 're not nearly enough to counter the fact that improvements to the gameplay are pretty slight and the level design is a big step backwards making the game a real lemon overall if this is the direction the series is taking it should probably stop right here take a look at activision 's vigilante 8 or gt interactive 's rogue trip instead
not terrible like the other reviews say .... it 's solid ... just not as good as parts 1 and 2 .... but at this point in time you should be playing the newest version released ... look it up
they sacrificed the create a character mode but in its place are like oodles of wrestlers.this game was made during one of wrestlings hottest eras.probably still is.so the wcw had lots o cash to hire lots o wrasslers and that s why there s zillions of them up for grabs.theres the regular wcw guys the nwo luchadors ravens flock japanese superstars losers you ve never heard of before and every other gang from that time.the only real problem is the game is very simple to beat.now i m not normaly one to complain about easy video games but this game got beat literaly in under 4 hours after i bought it on every level.its better if you re getting this for a kid i guess
this is one old school fun game to fight against your friends   you can not create any thing   hours of fun from royal rumble to regular matches and there is quite a bit of people to play as
this is and was the best wrestling game ever and the big bonus is it 's wcw nwo not wwe so all the wrestlers are awesome
thq 's second american release is a huge leap in graphics from the original world tour dozens of wrestlers from the nw0 wcw raven 's flock cruiserweights heavyweights and some of which are made up for the game the great thing about this game is it was back in wcw 's hay day when it had talented wrestlers like jericho benoit malenko and raven more talent means more moves more moves means more fun the only real modes other than battle royals and handicapped matches are a series of championship tournaments to go through in a specific weight talent class there are incredible looking arenas even with an isle to brawl in and weapons that you can pull from the crowd and bring into the ring the unfortunate part about this game is that it is dated and it moves very slowly compared to wrestlemania2000 and no mercy
this is my all time favorite wrestling game ever made i really enjoy this game alot the modes you have are exhibition tag team special matches like 2 on 1 you have also a 40 player battle royal which to me is my all time favorite feature in this game what so ever winning the titles in this game is alot of fun and to me this game is alot better than the overrated smackdown here comes the pain and it is alot easier than that game as well i do n't get why people say smackdown here comes the pain is so great when in reality it sucks because the ai in season mode is very cheap and i hate ai like that but in this game on easy mode the ai is way to easy but to me this game is just awesome and i still play this game alot to this day i never get tired of it
greatest wrestling game ever to this day not only does it feature the best wrestlers from the greatest time period in all of wrestlings history but that greatness translates into the game fun and very real controll like features ca n't say enough how great the game is
i always hated the wcw i was playing warzone attitude and wwf titles for a long time then i somehow ended up owning this game and i inteneded to dissmiss it but i found myself playing it more and more every day and eventualy loved it i was happy to hear thq got the rights to wwf and went from this to wrestlmania and then the best game on the 64 no mercy however this is the foundation of where it started and i respect it for that it brought a lot of awsome memorys and entertainment on hot summer nights i recomend no mercy over this but this original version deserves your respect
i should probably review some modern games while i 'm here but i 've been kinda gta'ed out recently so i decided to put the ps3 away for a minute and bring up some old games from the past to see if they 're just as fun as i remember them as   one of those titles was wcw nwo revenge released during wcw 's heyday and roughly a few months before wcw 's eventual downfall the game showcases an astoundingly deep roster for game that came out in the 90s   a total of 63 wcw nwo wrestlers were divided up into different factions   wcw 1 main event wrestlers wcw 2 mid card wrestlers wcw 3 opening match wrestlers wcw 4 cruiserweight wrestlers nwo white nwo red and raven 's flock   further there were roughly a dozen or so other wrestlers listed under the imaginary ewf and daw leagues included in the game these wrestlers were modeled after japanese wrestling stars but had their likenesses changed to avoid copyright issues the controls of the match are simple enough for anyone to jump in and learn but you have to understand the psychology of wrestling and use the controls accordingly if you want to go deep into the championship modes of the game   players use the b button to strike a button to initiate a grapple the d pad to move and the joystick to either taunt or execute a special move   the player can differentiate between a weak strike grapple and a strong strike grapple by holding the respective button down until the move is executed   the more worn down your opponent is the better chances you have of successfully hitting them with a strong attack   yet if you try to initiate a strong grapple on an opponent who 's not worn down they 'll likely reverse the attack and counter with one of their own   so much like real wrestling you have to wear your opponent down with the weak attacks until you move up and hit them with the strong ones and also like wrestling it 's a good idea to generate a response from the audience by letting out a taunt while your opponent 's down   once your spirit meter is full you can strike an opponent with a special move by initiating a strong grapple and then moving the joystick or alternately using the joystick when on the turnbuckle if the finisher 's an aerial maneuver   the controls also allow you to run leave the ring block counter an attack dodge an attack and set your focus on another opponent if you 're involved in a handicap or tag team scenario the game has several modes   championship exhibition and special modes   the exhibition mode is a singles or tag team match where the player can face either the computer a friend or a few friends since the game supports up to 4 players   the championship modes allow the player to compete for the wcw tv championship the wcw cruiserweight championship the wcw tag team championship the wcw united states championship and the grand daddy of them all the wcw world heavyweight championship affectionately referred to as the big gold belt   while the path to the television titles and the cruiserweight titles are n't terribly challenging you will need to bring your a game when competing for the higher tiered titles or you can dial the difficulty down to easy either or   the special modes essentially allow the player to engage in specialty handicap or battle royal exhibition matches with the former allowing for 2-on-1 or 3-on-1 battles while the latter will have 4 competitors fighting each other in the ring until one 's eliminated with the option to allow up to 40 contestants to enter the match   you 're also given a mode where you can customize the given wrestlers to either have different names or to have them wear different costumes the upside to the game is that it 's still fun to play even 15 years later   as i said earlier anyone can pick up the controllers and jump in while the subtle nuances of the game do n't take much effort to figure out as you go along   the soundtrack is limited but i do n't ever think anyone confused wcw 's entrance music with the music that jim johnston of wwe fame has released over the years with the only exception being goldberg 's theme   the graphics were a work in progress considering where the franchise was at by the time wwf no mercy was released but it was still leaps and bounds better than what most expected from the gameplay of other systems at the time as a reminder this game was released for a console that is three generations removed from what 's available today   if there was one drawback from the game it 's the limited gaming options that exist   once you beat the championship mode that was essentially it as far as beating the game was concerned   there were no steel cage match options tag teams were limited to 2-on-2 action and the create a wrestler option would n't be introduced until thq aki began releasing titles for wwf   other gripes i have are that you ca n't seemingly control whether or not someone interferes on your behalf and the fact that the cpu can hulk up their spirit meter rather effortlessly while the player has to do all the little things right to make that possible with all that said however the game 's fun factor makes it a legitimate must have for wrestling fans and should be considered by n64 fans who are looking for a beat em up button masher where the top prize is the wcw championship   i recommend this to n64 gaming fans wrestling fans and people who watched wrestling when it was cool
i remember when this game first came out it was mind blowing as to just how awesome it was it had basically anyone everyone you 'd ever want in a wrestling game minus some legends and if you had 4 controllers 3 friends ..... it was going down for hours well this game is still pretty cool despite it 's age the graphics obviously do n't look as awesome as they used to but still they could look worse .... and the gameplay is still easy to pick up enjoy infact i wish the wrestling games of today could get the controls simple fluid as on this n64 game if they could remake this game w/ an expansive create a player wrestler and simple controls i 'd easily buy that too i highly recommend this to anyone that is a game collector or anyone who has n't played games of this era but are getting older games there is a crap load of characters cool match modes and as i stated earlier get controllers some buddy 's
great game one of the best of n64 next to paper mario and zelda oot ofcourse anyway buy it if you have a n64 and also get wcw nitro for ps1 anyway buy this and nitro and thunder all for ps1
i had purchased quite a few games trying to find the one i remember this game is fun and has a good roster of   characters the moves are simple and the game is fun hours on end a good way to relax after a tiring day
i loved this game when it first came out and to this day it 's one of my favorites the wrestlers most of them anyway have a whole lot of moves and they are not all the same for every wrestler the inclusion of the real wrestlers signature moves is very cool one of the things i especially like about the game is the number of wrestlers on it there are 62 of them --- that 's a lot more than a lot of later wrestling games have a few of them are locked at the start but they 're not really that hard to unlock --- at least not with the difficulty level on easy several wrestlers who were later on the legends games hogan macho man sting bret hart steiners and others are here some of the wrestlers are made up or at least i assume they are the graphics are good the wrestlers are blocky but the real wrestlers faces are very realistic the play control is very good --- a lot better than the play control on world tour the 40-man battle royal is really cool there are several different arenas which is kinda neat but in my opinion does n't really do that much for the game the sound effects and music are in my opinion not great but good enough the wrestlers do n't have individual entrance music but oh well --- no biggie again my opinion there is no commentary but that 's fine with me because i always turn off the commentary on games anyway one of my fave game features is the costume change mode this mode lets you take wrestlers and put other wrestlers outfits on them and lets you edit the colors of the outfits that 's fun i think so anyway you can even change the wrestlers names but why would you ever really want to do that unless maybe somebody like giant has changed their name in real life there is n't much if anything about this game that i have any major complaints about sure it 's dated now but i still find it as fun as i did back in 1998 i think that 's when it first came out just because something is old now that does n't mean it is n't still good
tomb raider 3 is the hardest of the tomb raider series at least in my opinion it has a very complicated plot decent graphics and a moderate amount of action -- although i have not completed it myself it could use more action and less puzzles however the biggest problem with it that i 've faced is that it has a lot of bugs and errors throughout some errors can be fixed without a lot of hassle others can be fixed but with a lot of hassle and some ca n't be fixed at all myself i do n't have a lot of patience i just play the game because i love challenges so unless you have a lot of patience or enjoy tough challenges like i do tr3 is not for you
to this very day i still can not understand why everyone loves tomb raider so much aside from the odd improvement here and there the games have n't changed vastly i think doom to quake is vastly at all i find controlling lara very clumsey the 3rd person view not help plus lara does all the aiming so the satisfaction of blasting something 's head off from a distance is non existent i found myself fart around half the time where 's the fun in climbing up a rock face i 'm all for puzzles but i find these games boring and labourious oh and lara croft is not fit because she 's not real and if she was she 'd fall forwards due to her massive mammaries so stop ogling at your screen you sad people
better than tr2 for sure it has some brain taxing levels filled with puzzles secrets and some enemies i 'm glad to see they have cut back on the enemies and focused on the puzzles and scenery they have definatly picked some good locations for the game with brilliant details that are authentic in style unfortunatly that is where the authenticity ends the level makers should have done some research on these locations and made them more like they are in real life ok i know it 's an adventure game that is meant to be fantasy but i do feel they could have checked things out first examples india dosn't have pyrannas(brazil does the ganges dosn't end in a pond st pauls cathedral looks nothing like that(that must be the worst rendition of it yet the british museum is not next to the lloyds building and area 51 is more spacious than that(i saw it on a tv programme i swear i wo n't judge the pacific levels though i do n't know enough about them they realy do need to watch their locations more enjoyable game though
have you ever sat for hours playing one particular video game and you can never find out what to do this is one of those games although it does hold a great assortment of fun weapons and great graphics but it 's hard   you do n't just go around firing guns at everything although i did not like   the first tomb raider either only because many of the enviroments looked   exactly the same though they both are good games but if your not willing   to put a lot of time into video games and just play for fun like me your   not going to like this one
i 've conquered hundreds of video games but unless you have serious amounts of free time on your hand the tomb raider series is not for you   i especially do n't like having to get a hint guide to progress through a   game   the first tomb raider was difficult but not unreasonably so the   puzzles made sense   the second one introduced a troubling trend of hiding   the solution to puzzles in nonsensical places and forcing a player to   backtrack and turn up the brightness constantly   in this game it is   virtually impossible to figure out swiftly where you need to go or what you   have to do   with larger levels come an increasingly frustrating inability   to simply figure out what you 're trying to do in that particular level   i   finally gave up after defeating two areas   i refused to buy the hint   guide but after flipping through it i was enraged at how impossible the   programmers made it to find the extra weapons and ammo   the game is   tough enough already without having to defeat levels with just your pistols   if you do n't buy the hint guide why the hell ca n't they just make the   game fun   the first one was just about right   i 'll never have the amount   of free time necessary to enjoy this series which i actually love   i have   more fun just wandering around and jumping then trying to defeat needlessly   obtuse puzzles   the only area really up to first tomb raider standards are   is the south american levels with the giant statues   argh
tomb raider 3 was by far the most difficult tomb raider i have ever played i 'll admit i used every cheat in the book in order to beat the game but can you really blame me?the game first starts off with an incredibly difficult jungle level in which you have the option of finding a few secrets and then beginning the level but regardless you 'll be jumping to a slope and then jumping over a set of spikes and then surprise jumping over another set of spikes and finally landing at the bottom with a save crystal and a bunch of different directions to go do n't go into the sinking sand and watch out for anything that looks dangerous because chances are it 'll be the last dangerous think you look at finally after a period of a week to a year you 've finally beat the jungle levels ... without cheats well i bet you were quite tempted now choose your destination the strategy guides all tell you to go to the nevada desert and then to the south pacific and then london if you watch the entire story so far ... &quot feature you 'll notice that the game plays the scenes with south pacific first and nevada desert last so nobody cares what order you do it in it does n't matter much and believe me you will get frustrated either way so go to the one you want to go to first because it will take you forever to finish that section of levels finally after god knows how long you finished the whole globe and get this you did it all without cheat codes i congratulate you now we get to go to antartica!!!yippee antarctica is incredibly difficult and it ends with a big mumbo jumbo mother of all spiders human headed thing oh and one shot with the rocket launcher just wo n't kill it and one thing to keep on mind one hit k.o. as in if it hits you once it will kill you good luck!but in spite of all of that i really enjoyed seeing lara in new costumes and playing in her new house it was a lot of fun to get the racetrack key and find the shortcut at the racetrack i must say i really did enjoy tomb raider 3.if you like challenges then tomb raider 3 is definitely for you and regardless the mansion is definitely worth the 5 dollars that tomb raider 3 now cost at game crazy but if you 're anything like me and do not enjoy getting so frustrated over a horribly pixilated british woman in a jungle tomb then get ready to memorize quot draw a flare take one step forward one step back turn around three times then jump forward&quot if you want to beat this game
yes i did find this a bit cumbersome i wanted a more puzzle oridented game i kept getting stuck in seemingly absurd situations and go to a walk through forum to make progress one of the comforts is that a cheat code can take you to the next level if you get frustrated through not being able to figure out some trick to advance lara is a great character but in this game she is faced with too many obstacles and impossible to discover secrets to make the game truly enjoyable
i loved the first and second tomb raider 's and this one is just amazing i love the story the graphics are good the gameplay is really easy and it 's relatively easy i know that many people say that this game is way too hard but there seriously mistaken it 's really not that hard it 's much like the other tomb raiders i still play it it 's such a good game.get this if you liked the other tomb raider games and pay no attention to the reviews that give this game 1,2 or even 3 stars just stick to that 4 's and the 5's.oh one more little thing ... if you have vista or a laptop you may have some sound effect problems but it usually fixes itself after you play it for a few hours
for those of you who have n't played super mario 64 i would like to say on behave of all of us that have your truly missing out super mario 64 was the very first video game i ever played on my nintendo 64 so my review could be a little biased but i just recently replayed the game from start to finish and it still has not lost its touch it 's a game for people that love adventures puzzles shooting and the occasional flying it never seizes to get old and the graphics are as good as they can get for the nintendo 64.the object of the game is simple bowser has kidnapped princess peach and you mario the greatest plummer in the world must save her bowser is hiding somewhere in the castle and you must find him by collecting all of the hidden stars scattered throughout various paintings that give mario his power to find bowser you must climb to the top of the tower each floor requires a certain number of stars that have to be collected before you can move on every painting that has stars in them are magical paintings that mario can jump through to transport himself to a different world were he can explore for stars overall i rank the game a 9/10 for its creativity and several different ways it keeps players focused and entertained the makers of mario did a fantastic job integrating so many different aspects of gaming which in turn made it so great i hope that whoever is reading this can come to their senses and buy this game
even though this game is almost 4 years old it is still one of the best games that the n64 has to offer   why   well dear reader i will tell you why   super mario 64 is a gaming revolution   it was the game that everyone had to have   it took mario into a whole new atmosphere   the world that is inside princess peach's(aka princess toadstool castle is immense and highly imaginative   although the graphics may seem a little bit dated(it was a launch game remember that it is still a sight to see   as far as play control goes it is a bit difficult to get the hang of moving mario around but once you get used to it then controlling mario is a breeze   in fact it is some of the best playcontrol that a game has to offer   the super mario 64 storyline is familiar to mario fans but at the same time a touch refreshing   yes peach is captured but she is being held prisnor in her own castle(in a picture in fact and one of the funnest parts of the game is hanging out outside   one of my problems is that luigi is not in the game in fact no mention of him is made either   nintendo should have left the mario party franchise alone and focused on creating a super mario 64 2 but alas they did n't   so if you own a nintendo 64 and do n't have this title or are thinking of buying a n64 then get super mario 64 because it is by far a true gaming experience
1996 was a fairly important year in the realm of video gaming the super nintendo entertainment system dies out in the united states diablo comes out for the pc however the biggest news is the launch of nintendo 's amazing new system the nintendo 64 which was lauded for its beautiful graphics and a brilliant new controller two games were released along with the system there was pilotwings 64 which was not exactly what was expected but the other game was called the greatest game of all time as of 1996 that is at least in the eyes of critics by several source and it really was the first thing that strikes your eyes is its delicious eye candy the first thing that pops out at you after the title is giles goddard 's mario face and boy does it look good but enough with the intro it 's time to see whether the game itself passes the graphics test answer yes it does even after five years super mario 64 is still one of the most beautiful games for nintendo 's crowning glory speaking from a fanboy 's pov the character and tree designs are very outdated by today 's standards but the water is still lovely though surpassed and some of the brick and stone backgrounds still are the most realistic that i have ever seen today the graphics would get a c by reviewers but back in 1996 this game would get an a+.but who cares how it looks let 's see how it sounds the answer great before 1996 nintendo fans never had a chance to hear mario talk but the first thing that greets you when you turn on the system is a jingle and the words it's a me mario and hello while a remixed version of the classic mario theme plays in the back but again this is only the intro the question is whether games sounds that good the answer naturally would be even better mario comes packed with a large batch of sayings including mama mia here we go and press start to play unfortunately everything else other than peach and bowser do n't talk in anything else other than words but remember the fact that this is a first generation cartridge game and if people complain for zelda then they should n't complain here the music and sound effects are just divine outside the castle you are greeted with the happy chirping of birds and the roaring of a nearby waterfall enter and the cozy castle theme starts playing each of the levels come equipped with music that ranges from peaceful to energetic to somber the bowser fight music ranges from rock to organ music and it 's all wonderful now that the graphics and the sound are out of the way let 's get into the meat of the game the gameplay the first thing most people would notice is how different this is from traditional mario games there are only 1-up mushrooms and the only pipe that appears is in the very beginning however super mario 64 is 3d and most of those elements just would n't work in a 3d game the story according to the manual is that peach invites mario over to the castle for a cake when mario reaches the castle he is greeted with a gruff voice wondering what went on mario explores the rooms and finds a giant painting where he can jump in there he finds himself in a new world with a giant bob omb on the top he fights and defeats it you 'll have to do that part yourself and gets a star later he learns that bowser has attacked the castle captured the princess stolen the power stars and has sent his army to take over the worlds inside the paintings then the world itself yeah so it is n't much different from other mario games but that 's not the point the point is there are 120 stars out there although 70 is need to beat the game but where 's the fun in that for you to collect your misson to explore 15 worlds to find those 120 stars well instead of having a super mario and a mario like in past mario games mario has 8 life bars hitting certain enemies would make him lose 2 life bars as well falling from semi high heights burning mario 's butt will make him lose 3 certain other enemies and falling from really high heights will make him lose 4 but do n't worry coins and water will replenish your health if you lose all 8 or fall down a pit you lose a life but for every 50 coins you get with a star and every 1-up mushrooms you get a life your moves include the standard running punching butt stomping as well as the kick the long jump the wall kick the side somersault and the backflip you can also swim there are three special caps that gives you special abilities the flying cap gives you the ability to fly the metal cap gives you the ability to walk underwater and be immune to enemy the vanish cap gives you the ability to walk through enemies and certain walls mario most employ all of those ablities to save the princess and the world the nintendo 64 controller with its analog stick makes it possible for mario to perform the tasks successfully just imagine travelling in a 3d world with a d pad some people complain about the camera angles and how you have to control them with the c button it may be annoying at first but eventually you 'll get used to it and it 'll come naturally and you 'll learn to play with the bad angles super mario 64 not only has good graphics good sound and good gameplay but the fact that it is revolutionary in that it brings gaming into the 3d world makes it not only the best game of 1996 but possibly also the best game ever that 's right even better than castlevania and super metroid
super mario 64 is a great game and is what i would call the best platforming game of all time pros+ memorable music and imaginative courses.+ game play is always straightforward and never confusing.+ 120 stars to collect for long playing time.+ graphics were great back when it was made and is not painful to look at now cons- while this game does have replay value you are n't compelled to play again after you beat it give it a while and you will definitely want to play again this game was not too hard for me and i beat it when i was in the single digits as a child that given it should n't be too hard for any age buy this game now if you have n't ever played it since it is one of those video games you have to beat
i only bought a n64 recently but played it numerous times at friends houses   i 've already got a ps2 with 38 games and 6 for the n64 and have played god knows how many others but i have to say that super mario 64 is on my top 5 list
i recently tried playing this game and by this point my n64 is lucky it did n't get chucked out the window the first few passes through the first few stages were fine and pretty fun but the rest of the game ends up being one long annoying tedious impossible and frustrating chore to start off the control just is n't good enough to pull off half the things you need to do in this game there are instances where you must execute specific jumps to get you from point a to point b but half the time the controller is non responsive especially when it comes to levels that put you high up this usually means falling ... over and over again!to add to this annoyance is the fact that there are no check points if a level requires you to go to the top of a mountain and you spend half an hour just getting up there and then you fall you have to climb the whole thing all over again so if you 're like me and find your self wondering off cliffs every other try because of the awful camera work you will be playing the same stages over and over with no payoff but one big headache!now let 's talk about the camera throughout most of the game i found my self fighting it more than i fought bowser it 's simply impossible to judge distances based on where the camera is facing at any given time pressing the c buttons will move it around but you have to keep perfectly still in order to avoid suddenly gong sideways or backwards if you are in a stage where there is a time limit or a complicated jump this can be particularly fatal adding to this frustration is the fact that it is incredibly easy to over or under jump this would n't be as much of a problem if it were n't for all the levels which require you to get to the top of things again if you fall once that 's it you start all over again if the game designers were n't going to give you any continue points in these levels why o why did they make it so friggin easy for you to fall!!!???there are plenty of levels and stages in this game and lots to do in all of them but by the time i cleared one stage i really questioned whether or not i wanted to even go to the next finally after reaching a mere 52 stars my answer is no so that 's my two cents on this game i ca n't beat it i do n't want to beat it i 'd rather go to a morrissey concert with kathy griffin as the opening act than try to play it again it would me much less annoying than this game
this game is so easy that it is beyond belief and i mean that too   some people think that they 're the greatest nintendo players of all time just because they beat super mario on the n64 console   big deal   this game is incredibly and i mean incredibly easy   it 's okay but nowhere as near as good as zelda   however if you want a game that 's excellent for the n64 get this game   here 's my pros and cons for this highly wonerful and yet laughably easy game pros wonderful graphics addictive gameplay every now and then there 's puzzles that are mildly challenging un predictableness with the creatures in this game make it fun cons awkward camera angles too easy that you should beat it in about two or one month controls are weird and at times confusing graphics are good but at times there are major glitches this games levels look alike every now and then the plot sucks   it does   save the princess and jump through paintings and destroy bowser   come on!bowser bosses are not difficult at all   you can beat all three of them in like less than a day if you try hard enough i did it in one day true story i swear)and there you go   hopefully this review helped somebody out
this game was the premiere launch game for the nintendo 64 when it premiered and despite the fact that it is only a single played game pulls off fun gameplay and great graphics despite the fact of newer systems like xbox ps2 and even nintendo 's own gamecube i would still be happy to have this game sitting on my shelf next to games like red faction and halo this game prved itself showing off the power that the nintendo 64 had and showed it off to the loyal people who bought one instead of a ps x and even those who like me bought both a nintendo 64 and a ps x. but not to mince words i 'll explain the game you are mario one of the most well known characters in video game history you play through this adventure all in 3d. this was one of the true selling factors of this game as it was mario 's first true step into the third dimension hushed gasp but the game sold great and over time has proved in it 's own right that it is a classic
super mario 64 is a game i 've wanted to play for ages i finally decided to purchase it and i was not disappointed in my opinion super mario 64 is the best in the mario series and one of the best games ever this game was a breakthrough in 3dplatformers and it 's easy to see why the 3d is great for its time and the style is incredible the game is addictive as well i would play for hours and hours and would n't want to stop and super mario 64 does not get tiresome after you beat it for the first time the plot is simple bowser kidnaps princess peach and mario must save her but the plot 's not important in a video game the game play is what matters the game is fast paced and you always have new areas to unlock despite not having any other areas to go to outside of princess peach 's castle there are tons of areas inside getting to new areas is simple you need a certain amount of stars to unlock doors and unlock enough doors to unlock boss doors overall there are 120 stars in the entire game and i would recommend a guide because of how challenging it is when battling bowser in this game i was disappointed he 's so easy when i beat him the first time i was surprised how easy he was it was more difficult getting to bowser than it was battling him but all three incredible boss stages that were before the battles are so much fun it makes up for it there are also hidden items characters and power ups for mario to find now there are a few problems like any other game that i think are quite frustrating mario 's controls sometimes are a little tough his wall jumps have to be so precise and if you mess up you have to do it again and again and the camera sometimes can be tough to use in certain areas but despite these problems it 's still a great game this game is a must own for mario fans while yet you must already know this since i 'm writing this review thirteen years later super mario 64 will always be known as one of the best 3dplatformers in video game history
this game is so much fun   i 've always been a big fan of mario since the beginning   the graphics are great and the sound is pretty good too   there are many different goals to reach in each level   whether you have to collect coins or stars to open new levels i know you 'll love this game
i grew up playing super mario 64 if you are considering buying this game do n't hestitate or think twice this game is really fun it can keep you entertained for hours the graphics are simply stunning even by today 's standards considering the age of this game it is a classic must have for any n64 players mario fans or video game fanatics
i 'm pretty sick and tired of people calling super mario 64 a classic   it 's not   just because it 's significant and influential in helping pave the way for future mario titles does n't mean super mario 64 is deserving of its classic status or that it 's any fun to actually play   super mario galaxy came along and pretty much improved every single aspect of super mario 64 so you basically no longer have to play this game other than to get a dated taste of mid 90 's gaming history   the only other possible reason someone would play super mario 64 is because they desperately seek open world exploration and this is basically the only mario platformer that can at least attempt to satisfy gamers with that particular appetite   not that i personally believe the game succeeds at the exploring aspect either the biggest problem is that so much of the land you explore consists of emptiness   oh sure you 'll see trees ramps castles buildings enemies such as goombas chain chomps badly and laughably animated thwomps lifting up and slamming down pokeys rolling boulders and other things that have become a trademark of the mario series but the amount of items to find and collect is extremely limited to coins both yellow and red ones and the occasional power up that enables mario to either fly which admittedly is pretty fun or obtain the incredibly boring metal cap that makes mario invincible   an alternative to the starman perhaps with lousy side effects mario ca n't jump as high or far while wearing the metal cap).when you 're not experiencing the endless disappointment that is running across empty and boring lands and basically doing nothing but wasting time you 're jumping across a series of unspectacular and very ordinary presented platforms over and over again   this stuff seriously resembles a beginners course for developing platforms   it 's extremely basic game design   the platforms are generic square shaped tiles for you to jump across that quite often are all the same exact size   it gets monotonous almost immediately   only unreasonable nintendo fans would eat this stuff up seriously   anybody else would obviously be able to detect flawed repetitive gameplay   the 2d mario games move at such a swift pace that you do n't even have time to stop and notice the platforms unless you 're an extremely slow gamer   this is mainly because you do n't have to stop and situate mario a certain way for the purpose of making the perfect jump which is what severely ruins super mario 64 's gameplay   and do n't even say my skills are horrible when it 's obvious through countless youtube videos that several gamers have the same exact issue while i 'm by no means someone who cares about the best graphics available you got ta admit the ones here have dated horrendously with embarrassing blocky shapes pretty much occupying most areas of the game   the buildings water and trees in particular are just awful for the eyes   nothing appealing whatsoever about any of the graphics- even the bright inviting colors do n't lure me in but rather rub me the wrong way and force some of us older gamers to recall the unpleasant days of mario paint you have to collect 120 stars in order to complete the game 100 but guess what   many of the stars are flat out boring to collect due to being pathetically easy and basically being handed to you within minutes   what kind of challenge is that   the one where you have to swim around and open treasure chests in a certain order is baby ish and the one where you swim around collecting 8 predictably located red coins inside a basic building near the beginning of the game is offensive   or how about simply stomping a post into a ground to release a gate and thus release the star   do n't even think about mentioning the ones where you walk up to toad and he simply hands you the star   granted the game seems to always alternate easy star collecting challenges with longer and more drawn out ones as a way to balance things out but that 's the problem- the stars are either too easy or too long   there is one star mission so awful it makes your inevitable death seem like something to anticipate- the one where you have to jump across a series of moving poles   you have to jump at just the right moment while making sure you 're positioned in the right spot   this takes forever and is dreadfully annoying also what 's up with all the little baby games   grab a baby penguin and slide down a snowy hill   chase the bunny so he does n't hop away   these are not suitable for anyone who recalls the challenging portions of previous 2d gaming such as super mario bros. 3 or super mario world and yes these bunny grabbing missions are flaws in super mario galaxy too in case you think i 'm intentionally favoring super mario galaxy for no reason   at least the cannon shooting parts are cool   it 's fun figuring out where to launch mario so he can land safely on upper grounds i ca n't help but feel the red star collecting is overrated   when you collect red stars in yoshi 's island you feel like you 're given a really elaborate and perfectly executed assignment since you also have to collect flowers and stars to 100 complete a stage   it 's a lot to do not to mention really darn exciting and satisfying once you 've acquired all these items and constantly keeps your attention span in check while searching for them   super mario 64 basically takes that one red coin collecting element of yoshi 's island and makes it a main priority here   you often have to collect 8 red coins per stage opposed to 20 in yoshi 's island to obtain one of the 120 stars   ugh but nothing nothing is worse than the fact you have to re enter stages over and over again just to grab all the stars that are located throughout   to me this is unquestionably lazy game design   how can it be anything else   who in their right mind would actually want to keep going back to the same exact stage ad nauseam   super mario world was guilty of this too granted but not nearly to this exaggerated extent   a terrible idea that gives a false impression a game has replay value but it 's exactly the opposite- once you go through the same stage a bunch of times and finally accomplish everything there is to offer you wo n't want to repeat these same objectives ever again   so ... you probably wo n't want to play super mario 64 ever again   even worse- when you often have to search for 100 coins to obtain a star   this can take up to 20 minutes and bore you the entire time   being forced to collect 100 coins is a lazy way of assuring gamers do n't leave any stone unturned because you basically have to thoroughly search every nook and cranny of a stage to even find 100 of them i also dislike how many of the classic enemies are n't included here such as the hammer brothers buzzy beetles bloopers and cheep cheeps   even the koopa troopa is nowhere to be seen well other than that one race in the beginning   you can ride a koopa shell like a skateboard but that does n't count as an enemy appearance   he 's not a true enemy here   why is that   why not include all the familiar and well loved enemies that have become a trademark to the mario series   they ruin the pirahna plants by the way   why is he sleeping   granted he comes alive when you get near but it 's a really weird concept   at least nintendo got the boos and haunted house right- a surprising and exciting maze like high point of the game   it 's a lot of fun sorting through each room of the haunted house stages   that 's how you design a memorable stage   obviously if you were n't busy running around through several vast and average designed empty fields of grass there could have easily been room for the inclusion of more enemies   hey i 'm all for open world exploration but you have to actually fill in those areas with exciting creative items that are both fun and rewarding to collect for the player and enemies that present threatening encounters and a rush of excitement   simply throwing mario into a big 3d world because it 's his first grand 3d adventure truthfully is n't going to get the job done i 'm afraid   more needs to be done constantly having to rearrange the camera so you can see where you 're actually going is a nuisance   nobody likes dealing with a camera while jumping around trying to play a video game but granted several games back in the mid to late 90 's were guilty of the same camera problems since developers were still getting their feet wet so to speak and figuring out the best way to help players accurately and conveniently see what 's ahead   still you 'll lose more than a few lives due to bad camera angles in super mario 64   i guarantee it   one thing i do like about this game is how fast mario runs   it 's a fast moving game which helps going from point a to point b more convenient also some of the wall jumps and triple jumps are fun to execute   reminds me of super metroid in that respect   yoshi is teased in this game i wo n't spoil how but he 's not actually playable which does n't make sense   why make an appearance if he 's not going to be playable?the music is either extremely good the brilliant peaceful moodiness of the water theme and the intimidating and exciting heavy metal like bowser fights or downright horrendous everything else which consists of annoying nursery rhyme children 's themes inappropriate and painfully skull smashing for the rest of us   i ca n't stand the theme songs that play in whomp 's fortress and rainbow ride- two unforgivable themes that make me want to smash my brains in whenever i play super mario galaxy 2 where they return in all their overbearingly annoying glory   rainbow ride in particular reminds me of a county hayride where kids ride around on tractors not to mention the stage itself is extremely tedious and overlong   the snowy mountain stage with the italian accordion music is sickening and out of place   just mute the volume on your tv to make life easier for yourself   the boss fights are incredibly simplistic- grab bowser 's tail spin him around and toss him or pick up stomp other bosses   basic boring stuff a few stages that are actually fun include lethal lava land where the platforms convincingly feel like an upgrade into the 3d world from the original super mario bros. castle levels not to mention better more interesting use of platform jumping compared to the rest of the levels in sm64 shifting sand land since it 's packed with obstacles and enemies and reasonably challenging overall and tall tall mountain 's tricky climb to the top involving a vine climbing portion   in fact to be fair tall tall mountain is one of the best levels ever in a 3d mario game   it 's that good   bowser 's castle levels are pretty solid as well mostly due to the fast paced nature of them several things feel tacky- the 1-ups and coins are small dark ugly looking and clumsily made due to less than spectacular graphics and game design and overall super mario 64 is just a really lackluster and highly overrated game   if not for influence this game would have been forgotten and the superior super mario galaxy series would have prevailed even more dominantly than they already do   oh and do n't even mention the cake eating storyline   it 's atrocious   the fact they brought it back for the galaxy series makes me want to vomit
super mario 64 was the first game to be available for the n64 i remember the first time it came out how it 's graphics music and gameplay really amazed me sadly very few games came after it to give much competition to this day it still remains one of the best n64 games out there the sheer scope of the game is enough to pick it up it 's made up of 20 levels that can be played in a semi non linear order the graphics are bright and clear and the animations are creative for each character gameplay is pretty deep but extremely intuitive and becomes second nature after playing for a short time the real plus in this game is the music some of the most catchiest to be written for a game to date pick this one up for both its historical value and for the fact that its a great game
this game is coooooollll me abigail has this game and i have 120 stars they were soo easy to find i do not know how i became an expert at this for your information i am an expert in all of my video games i must feel like the luckiest girl in the world but i 'll give you a little info title rainbow ride/ star#2you'll have to take another magic carpet ride through low flying areial obstacles to reach the cloud house the blue blocks that float in your way are bigger on this carpet ride and you 'll have to jump on them quickly before the carpet moves out from under your feet the magic carpet will take you through the cloud house twice on both trips whatch out for the jet of fire that comes out from the fireplace i'ts best to stay to the rear of the carpet until the fire is out then go to theleading ledge of the carpet if you get knocked off the carpet it 's a log trip back to a spot where you can remount it there 's a warp to the top of the maze on the cloud house balcony
still the best 3d game on the market challenging tons of fun levels and amazing gameplay a true model for 3d games
when i first played super mario 64 as a kid i was amazed i never even had the game though heck i never had a nintendo 64 this game like many other nintendo 64 titles encouraged me to go out and buy myself a nintendo 64 16 years after its release i used to play this game with friends and cousins playing it now brings back such great memories this game is what a game is all about an unforgettable story an interesting environment and overall fun this game does n't get old in my opinion it beats out most modern games today super mario 64 formed the basis for all 3-dimensional video games if you were considering getting this game do n't consider any longer get it
i do n't know how many times i 've played this game from start to finish like a lot of people my decision to buy a n64 was based on the mario 64 commercials the wow factor was in full effect when i got home and started playing it literally felt like the first time i experienced atari or the sega genesis blown away would be an understatement the game itself?perfection even with a few minor things the good m64 ushered in a whole new age of platforming brought us 3d platfroming that was just about perfect in every way the graphics for it 's time were second to none the control was spot on the story line was simple but cute like all mario games hidden secrets like being able to wall jump up to the roof i could go on and on ....... the bad?my only gripe is the camera the camera can get quite wonky in places and funny ... even to this day bad cameral angles still plague 3d games nintendo and other companies have for the most part gotten the camera down with the free moving camera feature too bad some companies are still completely clueless to summarize perfection groundbreaking a legend that spawned a thousand imitators some good most ... not so good can't beat the original highest recommendations
this is an amazing game one that you can enjoy playing from the start to the finish
for anyone who was a fan of video games they remember the year of 1996 the playstation made waves and drew many nintendo fans away with its 32-bit graphics and cd based games for the first time nintendo was being challenged on its own ground and they had to answer sony with a console of its own after they put the super nintendo system to rest they went to work and released the nintendo 64 to the public the odds were against them because with only two launch titles to choose from early adopters had to either pick pilotwings 64 a good game or super mario 64 this game was the reason nintendo 's console immediately flew off the shelves and showed that mario can make the jump to 3d and it was fun doing so i'll make my review short because other reviewers had covered the basics and importance of super mario 64 it stars mario in an open world where each stage is contained within various paintings scattered through princess peach 's castle the storyline is pretty typical by now king bowser kidnaps the princess and you jump in to rescue her the graphics are colorful bright and were a breakthrough in video game technology at the time the controls are perfect and take almost no time to get used to it 's a pretty challenging game so expect to replay certain stages over and over again so why did i give it 4.5 stars the camera is not perfect but back then getting the camera to work in any open world style game was difficult to program it always centers behind you but sometimes gets a little wacky when you go up ledges or around corners it gets annoying after awhile but you learn to tolerate it what made this game groundbreaking was that games of this type proved to be a challenge to make and to make it fun as well is really the main goal super mario 64 exceeds this and was a commercial success with gamers and gained much critical acclaim from reviewers of virtually every gaming publication those who say did n't like were in the minority and for reasons that were just too petty and silly while gaming has changed tremendously since 1996 this game shows that the platform genre was at one point the kind of games that everyone wanted to play and now you can either track down the cartridge or get this for the nintendo ds so if you have n't played this take a look for yourself as to why many gamers loved to play this game i highly recommend it
this game is excellent .... this game has state of the art graphics for its time .... and it still looks perfect now in 2008 ... you must own this
let me just say that i think mario 64 is a okay game as far as gameplay and graphics goes but every level get 's harder and harder it 's so hard it would take you months to beat it and by the time you do you would be white as a sheet from staying inside all the time and 50 of your muscles would atrophy also the ending really sucks it ends by princess toadstool saying let 's make a cake for mario then it 's over so do n't waste your time with this game
i got this game many years ago for the n64 and i just loved it the game presented a large challenge while at the same time made it very fun the music is the best heard in a game the graphics are superb for an n64 title and this mario game is a blast i guess the most noticeable feature are the environments that the game provides every environment that mario enters is just awesome i especially love the rainbow level and the snow level where all of the penguins are the best feature is the fact that every age group can enjoy the hours of entertainment from the game and they can all enjoy collecting stars from each stage to save peach and defeat bowser oh by the way the bowser levels are awesome fighting bowser himself is very fun as well the game is also good in the fact that it provides unsatirical yet not stupid humor as well this is great for younger gamers i guess the worst part of super mario 64 is the lack of replayability it 's like vice city where it will take months to play and finish the game but once it 's done you wo n't want to play it again without getting bored once the ride 's over you 'll feel like you ca n't go play it each day and the game is kind of wasted in that aspect overall if you are a fan of mario or nintendo then this game may just be suited for your needs my rating-9.2
i 'm not very good at video games so this game is pretty tough for me   i only have about 20 stars right now and i 've had it about a year   however other than the not so great 3d graphics and the silly camera angles it is a fun though challanging game   i look forward to someday getting all 120 starts   haha
what can i say this game is fun and funny at the same time from mario flying around with the magic caps to mario burning his ... cheeks on the hot lava this game is great my only problem with this game is the freakin camera angles ahhhhh sometimes i feel like i could just kick the lakitu that controls the thing angles sometimes get soooo akward that it makes it difficult to make a jump correctly .. or so you wo n't go flying down to your death other than that i give it a 4 would be 5 if the camera was better
this game was a very fun game you basicly go to a castle and you jump into a paintings .. each one leading you into a different world ... and in every world ... you have to find 7 stars ... one of em is the 100 coin star where you need to collect 100 coins then it pops up it 's the hardest star to get)there 's 16 worlds in all ... most worlds take hours to complete so this game well be well worth it .. this game right here is history ... it 's one of nintendo 's biggest hits ... and when you buy this game you 'll soon find out why
the best game for the nintendo 64 is this yhis game rocks really it does its one of the best n64 game i have ever played 10/10
i bought this game in 1997 over a year after it was released the first few weeks i played it i was amazed at the beautiful 3d graphics honestly   i had never seen 3d graphics before this game so it was awesome and   inspiring i love this game so i 'm writing this review there are some   memorable moments from this game like when mario ventures into the haunted   mansion or when he goes on a rainbow ride in the skies)all in all it   showcases the n64 incredible 3d graphics and the sound is n't half   bad the levels are interesting and sparse i beat this game with the   nintendo power guidebook and should take some time to crack the puzzles   basically the game is quite easy and not surprisingly it has enough   mini quests and puzzles to keep you occupied as for level designs i think   it 's excusable considering it 's first generation stuff but still deep   enough to immerse you again after a long absence ... my gripe is while   this game is really good i mean i 'm a big time mario fan from the first   mario game it 's only as good as it lasts i found it hard to go back to   this game after a while- cause it was like having discovered everything and   it made it hard to play through the whole thing again my advice play   selectively you need to get into the mood while i say that it 's without   doubt that i have never regretted buying this game even if i never play   this game again and leave it to collect dust not likely)-i'll always   remember this game as one of the finest moments of the n64 lifetime that   is 1996 2001).anyway every super mario game is groundbreaking smb1   created the side scroller smb2 was queer and fun smb3 is the greatest   platform game ever smb4 was one of the most replayed game i ever played   and this game is mario in 3d without luigi which is sad)but cheer up   people- the next generation is almost upon us but i know that when we look   at 3d graphics today we will know that this game had a part to play in   making this our reality today
i thought i already rated this but i just love amazon do nt you even the reviews are hilarious that i found on youtube and go on smosh on twitter
good game for it 's time period kinda miss the old 64 graphics the cartridge came before it 's due date and it works wonderfully thanks
when i first saw super mario 64 in 1996 i had to pick my jaw up off the ground   while 10 years have passed i still consider this game of the finest pieces of entertainment i have ever seen   the kinds of things that the development team pulled off in the mid 90s set the stage for all future video game development and it was is and always will be groundbreaking an achievement that should not be ignored and is still as much fun today as it was a decade decade ago highest possible recommendation
i remember when i was in high school and this game was brand new and just came out i played this sooooo much i got an ache in my hand i 've only beaten it once but i 'll tell you what in that one time it took me 3 to 4 months to beat it
even when it first came out i tried out this game but could not get into it and i hate the n64 old style 3d graphics where the camera angle ends up getting you killed every five seconds espessially in pits   of all the mario games to date including the amazing wii titles except for super mario wii this has to be the worst mario game for me since mario nes   the graphics are terrible the music is annoying and it 's just boaring
i could knock a few stars off by going on and on about what they should have put into this game -a playable princess animal costumes fire flowers etc.- but such negativity could foolishly ruin such a great game super mario 64 is n't perfect but it has the best damn gameplay of any action title the worlds are massive with lots of vibrant colors whacky enemies catchy music and most importantly gameplay the only downsides to this game are mario 's horribly annoying voice an occasionally fussy camera and the possibility of graining your n64 control stick when you fight bowser these minor neusances are mild though and they do n't really hinder the gameplay all other downsides merely point to the characters themselves mario speaks with a bad italian accent voiced by charles martinet instead of his old brooklyn one from the cartoon series i also do n't like the changes made to princess toadstool instead of the spunky redhead from the cartoon series she seems more like a dumb blonde with a weird voice yes this game is old but like fine wine games can get better with age
the 3d age began when mario was in 3d. a gem for n64!graphics 10/10 for a 1996 game these look great it 's clear and unfuzzy sound music 9/10 nice music and mario talks!gameplay 10/10 mario has to go through 15 vast challanging worlds packed with a huge arsnel of moves he searches for power stars in a mission there are also hidden stars in the castles if you get all 120 you get a reward also mario has three cap powerups invisibility metal and winged you have to find them though believe it or not i think this is one of the finest entries of the series a must own it 's also being rereleased for the ds
it was incredible to see this game when it came out in 1996 my brother and i had our minds blown we lived in this game and mario kart and thought entertainment would never be the same years ago this was the one word on videogames it revolutionized everything and no one has duplicated it a must own and play it's ... just incredible
this game was one of my favorite games on the n64 ... one of 10 or 12 ... anyway this game is stunning graphicly for it 's time and the gameplay is a blast and challengingyou can find this game on any emulator site ... check it out
one of the best mario games ever made it was such a huge jump from the previous consoles looked and played amazingly hours of entertainment for anyone that enjoys adventure type games
super mario 64 is a classic pure and simple and there 's not much else i can say it 's a really good game with alot of stuff that 's fun to come back and do you can fly around with your wing cap or slide down a huge sliding board of ice mario 64 is pure classic pure fun
mario was always kind if a hard game for me i unlocked a lot of stars but a lot of the game went unlocked i never did beat the whole thing there are some cheats you can look up online for this game
this is a top classic mario game i would highly recommend getting it if you love the mario series very good game
i stand behind this game being the best super mario game nintendo has produced too bad it was on a system that people did n't enjoy too many complaints over the control and the game selection and graphics capability it was a true underdog but super mario 64 has so many good qualitiesthis game takes forever to beat some may think this is a nusance but its filled with many many wonderful levels of funeach level is unique and its organized in a wonderful fashion you never get too confused in nagivating the gamethere is always something new to find and many races and somewhat minigames that are actually entertaining and not ultimately annoy you you get frusterated when you lose you realize this is n't some easy game   you can breeze through its actually difficult appreciate that challenge because challenge is hard to come by in games these days graphics are n't overdone good you can find flaws especially these days the angles may alert some gamers as being old fashioned but think about it like this ... its not 2d. lol overall i love this game without a doubt i consider it amongst the top 3 of my favorite games if you have n't played this game you are really missing out on something go play it you 'll see how fun and exciting this game can be and believe me it only gets better
super mario 64 has some of the best graphics ever shown on a home console believe it or not but i like the graphics in super mario 64 more than the graphics in super mario sunshine sure the levels look great and have snappy tunes to match but the game is way too easy except for bowser mario 64 is overrated but still one of the best games ever made it is nt the best game of all time but it packs a powerful punch lets hope super mario 128 is even better with harder challenges better graphics and more levels i mean mario 64 was great but the sequel should be harder because i do nt really want to own 2 mario games that are too easy and not long enough
the original party game the nostalgia that this game brings back makes it a must buy!one of the best games of all times
so what is mario 's quest this time save the princess peach by defeating the evil bowser while collecting 70 stars in only 15 levels all 15 levels are contained in 1 huge castle it might not be the best mario game but it offers a new 3d world and a whole new realism it also has new features such as an energy feature where rather than collecting power ups like the fire flower you now collect a gold coin and you get a block of energy back now mario has far more of an offense rather than just stomping enemies he can now throw punches kicks and slide into enemies making full use of the 3d plane the enemies come to life in 3d such as huge chain chomps menacing goombas and annoying koopas the graphics could have been better because they make enemies out of simple colors rather than textures like more recent games have the music and sound effects are nice because mario now has a voice to be heard there are however only minimal power ups such as mario 's winged hat which allows him to fly and mario 's steel cap making him invincible
i do nt think i really need to tell you why this game is amazing if you have played it you already know
in these decades of the digital world with superior hardware and high definition graphics i do n't believe gamers will ever encounter the same life changing experience as those who have first hand seen mario evolve into a 3d masterpiece   the nintendo 64 is the best console of its time hands down and super mario 64 is a masterpiece
probably the most epic of the first generation of 3d platformers and certainly one of the most well known with 120 stars to collect you can spend quite a bit of time working up the perfect game just do n't go for that 34;unlocking luigi&#34 nonsense it was all an urban legend
this is wat made me love mario mario 64!this is the biggest game crammed into a cartridge i ve seen its musically awesome graphically it shows age and the camera is nt as good as it could be but i still have nt beaten it since then that s how massive how much gameplay there is to it!i remember sliding down caves smashing boulders back in the day now that a friend sold it to me i m in love with it
here 's a cool trick!(you have to have the 2nd key you get from bowser)topic snowman has your hatsent in from anubisget your blown off by the big snowman do n't pick your hat up at all instead go get a star it dosn't have to be a new star)and save and turn off n64 wait 10 seconds ..... now turn n64 back on go back to that level and one of the little snowmen that pops out of the snow will have mario 's hat on their head
where are all the green pipes!!!why is there no coin counter for running around the castle there are coins all over the place i want to collect a 100 coin castle star did you even think before you sent this to production bro is this even this games final form?!?the cake was a lie
i have been playing video games for years my first console was the original nintendo and then the super nintendo followed by the nintendo 64 super mario 64 came out when i was about 10 years old and it was an instant hit super mario 64 was the greatest super mario game of them all my nephew has a nintendo 64 and he wants some new games for his birthday i thought what 's better than super mario 64 i bought this for his birthday and he will love it i would recommend super mario 64 to anyone who wants to play a fun and family oriented mario game
i love this game it 's the best mario game on nintendo 64 it is fun and everyone would love playing this game
this is one of the best games ever made for the n64 console it will always be a reminder of my younger years and my kids love it
one of the launch titles for the n64 back in 96 super mario 64 had only a small band of rivals at the time the most prominent being star wars shadows of the empire and star fox 64 the game has stood the test of time in several factors one you can still find it brand new two the previous games mentioned are almost impossible to find unused three for a launch game the graphics were great but they are not as good as late comer banjo kazooie the story line is interesting and the levels are big but not as large as banjo kazooie you have to find 100 power stars that bowser stole from princess peaches 's castle and if you get all 100 you can go to a cannon near the castle hop inside shoot onto the roof of the castle meet yoshi mario 's dinosaur friend who will give a super new jump and 100 lives the games levels are challenging espicially the last few levels and the levels where you fave bowser you have to beat him three times are dangerous especially the last one from the sea to land to desert to snow covered mountain and to the desert and beyond mario must battle enemies in 3-d and collect six stars on every level five stars are attainable by completing tasks while the sixth is attainable when you collect 100 coins on a level the music is hummable and the characters are nice and mean this is still marios biggest adventure and with the coming of the gamecube and the fall in price for the nintendo 64 and its games super mario 64 is a must have i 've had my 64 since christmas 97 and also received super mario 64 which is still a great game
this is a change of pace for mario its 3d and you have to do tons of missions for each level while this adds depth do the game it can also make you really frustrated(especially because the n64 controllers are so awkward when you go to a mission and its really difficult to complete it my advice is that you should take a break from that level and play an easy fun one i wish this game did nt have so many jumping styles though mario sunshine is a thing for us to look forward to but will at be an action adventure game like this one is bowser even in it?we do n't know yet the one thing we do know is that the game cube controller is easier to use than the n64 one and that the new mario game 's guide will be easy to look for while i still say super mario bros 3 is the most fun mario game of all time this one comes close i prefer sonic adventure though i m not even all that good at most video games including mario 64)but even i can tell that mario 64 is a classic just because the levels i ve completed were so fun and still are
okay this game is the reason they created difficulty settings some of the stars are just plain infuriating to get and it has the exact same plot as every other mario game omfg bowser stole peach whatever shall we do get an ugly princess or something and where the hell are the king and queen anyways the hats were also poorly implemented the flying cap is hard to use the metal cap is rare at best and the computer can still see you when you use the invisible cap they should have stuck to the 2d side scroller and also where is yoshi the fact that in later levels the edge of the map is always a bottomless pit is also frustrating
this is so classic and we love it do n't forget to buy a rumble pack so you can feel when you crash or go over the railroad tracks
this game is really good it was the launch title for the nintendo 64 it 's a full 3d world the objective of the game is to collect the power stars in princess peach 's castle to get to the top of the castle to fight bowser and save the princess 70 stars out of the 120 are required to face bowser this game is really big too you can fly turn invisible and go through certain types of walls and turn into metal the game is really good and i would recommend this to anyone who has a n64 if you do n't have a n64 you can get it from the virtual console service on wii for about 10 bucks
one of my all time favorite games for the nintendo 64 i missed playing this and finally ordered the game just to feel the nostalgia ha the game works perfectly and i feel like a little kid again fighting bowser :d
this game is great and fun to play they are many powers that you can get like flying and so on the color of the background is alright the color look 's smooth and rich and bright there are lot of bosses that you have to beat and alot of stars to find in order to fine them look very very hard you never know a star could be under your nose the level 's are cooler and better than the other old mario games that i playden in a long time the level 's can be very very hot or very cold places or the level 's can have water so you have to swim or some of the level 's can be nice or normal in the game mario can do some cool moves like back flip and so on in the level 's you do n't get one star there are many star 's in one level each level has many star 's to fine get the star 's and be very very powerful
my nephew is having a blast playing mario again thank you he plays it all the time after school its hard for me to take him away from the game
super mario 64 is one of the most amazing games i 've ever played in fact it 's my second favorite game of all time next to super mario galaxy you get to explore the large levels freely and do most of the levels in any order you want gameplay and controls are simple and easy to pick up   but they 're very fun not only do the good graphics look 3d but the music also sounds 3d. some things in this game are just too great for words it 's easily the game of the decade for the 90 's easily beating out super mario world the second best which is amazing this game is far supirior to that overrated zelda ocarina of time i rate this game 100/100 it 's perfect
this great game is commonly overshadowed by the inferior n64 zelda games if you have the n64 without this game what are you waiting for buy this game super mario 64 has great gameplay sound effects music graphics and an excellent intro to top it all off
super mario 64 one of the greatest games for n64.story plot the story begins with a letter from princess peach inviting mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him however when he arrives mario discovers that bowser has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the power of the castle 's 120 power stars many of the castle 's paintings are portals to other worlds in which bowser 's minions keep watch over the stars mario explores the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars he gains access to more rooms as he recovers more power stars and eventually traverses three different obstacle courses each leading to its own battle with bowser defeating bowser the first two times earns mario a key for opening another level of the castle after mario defeats bowser in the final battle peach is released from the stained glass window above the castle 's entrance peach rewards mario by kissing him on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised him gameplay each course is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits the worlds are filled with enemies that attack mario as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance offer information or ask a favor such as pink peace loving bob omb buddies the player gathers stars in each course some stars only appear after completing certain tasks often hinted at by the name of the course these challenges include defeating a boss solving puzzles racing an opponent and gathering coins as more stars are collected more areas of the castle hub world become accessible the player unlocks doors in the castle with keys obtained by defeating bowser in special courses there are many hidden mini courses and other secrets to the game most containing extra stars needed to complete the game entirely some courses contain cannons that mario can access by speaking to a pink bob omb buddy after entering a cannon mario can be shot out to reach distant places when the player has the wing cap equipped cannons can be used to reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly the gameplay and control is fricken awesome u can control mario in more ways then 1.power ups some courses have special cap power ups which augment mario 's abilities the wing cap allows mario to fly the metal cap makes him immune to most damage allows him to withstand wind walk underwater and be unaffected by noxious gases and the vanish cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage abilities mario can wall jump long jump and many more music the music is all original nothing has been copied but the game music is awesome for each stage in short super mario 64 is a great game and it deserves respect this game is a must get in your video game collection this game also started the trend where super games have 64 in their name for example donkey kong 64 super mario kart 64 pilotwings 64 and super man 64.story 5/5 gameplay 5/5 music 5/5 powerups 5/5 overall 10/10 a+
the kids play this game at least once a week since they 've had it so yes its worth the money
surprisingly when nintendo created the n64 game system they had absolutely no idea of how succesful it would be the first game that the system ran on was also a scream it just sometimes comes to me as a surprise that a lot of these newer games that run on cd rom like the playstation 2 and the xbox may have faster and better graphics but not likely with the actual loading time nintendo 's super mario 64 remains as the most dynamic staple of any n64 system to date the graphics are just completely amazing and so strong from one angle to another in super mario 64 you guide mario through 15 terrific stages with exciting adventure around every corner the object of the game is to try collect as many stars as possible that are hidden in the game each star is very vital inorder to help you save peach whom is still known as princess toadstool from the vile bowser each course takes you from all depths of the secret kingdom from sea to the firey sky and even in a spooky ghost filled house the load up time for this and every other n64 game is much faster than the cd rom games for the pc and the other cd rom console games it is kind of sad nintendo stopped making fantastic games on cartridge like this and traded it for a cd rom gaming factory with the gamecube nevertheless super mario 64 is still the most superior game of the 20th century and that is not even a pizza faced lie
this is everything i thought it would be it was the first game i got when i got my n64 and it was great
i enjoyed this game   it was very fun   it was the very first game i owned for the n64 so i did n't really understand how the controls worked but this game was really easy to figure out   i love it   when i walk by it in stores and see it ... i 'm speechless   it is a great game and by the looks of it the price it down too   this is definently worth your money
i played this game when it first came out at a friends house but i never bought it i was not that in to the 64 back then but now i think it is very fun and entertaning the graphics r good for the 64 including that it was the first game ever for it that is why almost everyone who has a 64 has this game if u take the snes newest games graphics compared to this game which is only a couple years apart these graphics seem life like it has a great adventure but its weird that luigi is not in this game it adds much more new items charecters and levels i like that it is first person view unstead of the side view like on the past marios ever since this game most marios have been first person view this is why i want sm64 ds it is like the 64s but different graphics and differnent layouts i will get the ds one in the future but that s a different story like i said my top favorite game today
okay so when i decided i wanted to buy a new nintendo 64 my brain automatically said now where can i find super mario hours upon hours were spent on this game when i was a tweenager and i had so much fun with it so i went out as soon as i could and bought it again i was kind of worried because i had gotten some games with my system that i used to this were fun also but they ended up being a little too easy since i 'm older now but when i got this and played it it was exactly the same some easy levels and some that take forever to get through but in a good way i have had it for a month now and have n't gotten bored with it yet so i recommend this game to people of all ages i even let my 3 year old brother try it out and he had a blast even though he had no clue how to really navigate 100%.buy it
it 's a great game but you can get the same thing on your ds for a lot cheaper   so if you like portable devices get it on your ds
well i do n't acttully have 120 stars but that is how much you are suposse to get but i have 95 stars i am onyy 9 so please awnser my revies for me
okay the game is very addicting the sound graphics gameplay is all great but i discoverd something else funer super mario 64 ds that game is way better this game is good but that game is something you ca n't keep your eyes off remember when you finish the game and eyerything to do and ther'es nothing left to do well this ds game has mini games they are very addicting and fun you can draw on this as well the adventure mode takes longer folks you can play as yoshi luigi mario wario in the beginning of super mario 64,you could just walk in but thwe ds version is different you have to collect a rabbit to get in there is more room 's in this castle too with more levels instead of collecting 120 stars you have to collect 150 if you do n't have enogh money for a ds and the game but have a n64,dust off the original and have some fun or go out and buy your ds and game get whatever you have to play this though if you do n't think i 'm right then you will be sorry
i think mario is a   great game fighting bowser is the funnest part in this game the best part is when you see yoshi yoshi gives you 100 lives it 's fun looking for mario 's cap when mario loses his cap the game is one of the first 3d and is very good game for n64 even thoughgamecube has the best graphics the game is very graphical game the game may have many challenges even after you get 120 stars this mario game is very fun for n64 and i have to say this is one of the greatest hits i 've ever had for n64

i did n't use to be into mario or kirby but now i like them both as much as i like the legend of zelda series i still have many more games to purchase based on those 2 characters but i think supermario 64 is a great story game a killer for the old games meant for the gameboy so enjoy
greetings i am oklonia my review of super mario 64 is right here super mario 64 is a game that all master n64 gamers have to own!i do n't even need to tell the story what 's happened the same traditional story bowser kidnaps princess toadstool mario finds the princess rescues her and destroys bowser capcise the courses and star 's names are quite creative e.g. lil penguin lost they are more riddles though the graphics are so sharp looking and realistic that maybe just a few could go on gamecube gcn)despite a few annoying sounds and no multiplayer mode super mario 64 is really super!this has been oklonia
quot;super mario&quot is arguably the most successful and most recognizable brand name in the history   it seems that every time nintendo releases a new episode in the series it hits video gaming gold   from the earliest release of the original quot;super mario brothers&quot on the original nintendo entertainment system it has always been a hit   even lesser known titles in the series like quot;super mario world 2 yoshi 's island&quot stay faithful to the series and produce very entertaining gameplay   with the dawn of nintendo 's three dimensional 360 degree rotating platform nintendo 64 the question became quot;could nintendo maximize the potential of this new platform and give mario a fresh angle?&quot   the answer in the form of quot;super mario 64&quot proved to be a quite emphatic quot;yes!&quot;&quot;super mario 64&quot takes the technique of multiple goals for each level introduced in quot;super mario world&quot and expands it in a quite impressive manner   there are 15 worlds mario must navigate in an effort to free the princess who is trapped in paintings in her castle   the goal is to accumulate at least 70 stars to unlock the passage way the final battle with bowser   as each world contains 7 stars of its own in addition to 15 bonus stars around the castle it would seem to be a walk in the park   however all is not as it seems   several of the doors leading the different worlds are sealed off either by locks or star requirements   therefore there is a limited amount of ways to accumulate the necessary stars until more stars are attained or earlier battles with bowser are won   of course this leads to a journey through amazing worlds were mario travels the depths of the ocean soars in the open sky battles over scorching lava and even gets to sneak through a haunted house   the variety of worlds and objectives are truly amazing as are the new moves mario can make to help accomplish these goals   no longer content to just move forward and jump mario can now do backflips long jumps wall leaps and crawls one other aspect of quot;super mario 64&quot that makes it standout is its use of rotating camera angles to track mario 's movements through each world   it takes some getting used to but it enables a truly three dimensional feel   this is game that nintendo built its release of nintendo 64 around   it delivered magnificently then and with its continual replay value still delivers today
i had a positive but more negative experience with this game i did beat it a few times at the final level defeating bowser but the game crept me a couple of times i could not fully control the buttons on the controller in order to figure out where i mario was plus there were some enemies that were scary and immortal i could not stay in the water for too long or else i would die however the game was the first 3d mario adventure type with cool graphics and so i rank this game the second in the list of most difficult mario games maybe 5 as total ever the winner is super mario bros. 2 in my opinion
super mario 64 was and still is one of the best and most revolutionary video game ever made   the game was a launch title for the nintendo 64 and boy did the game make its mark on the console   sure we have games like banjoe kazooi ocarina of time but this game was the first to come out and is still an instant class and started many many famous game rippoffs(like many people say banjoe kazooi was a ripoff but i didn't say that so do n't flame me!)but that 's beyond the point this game is still one of the most beloved video game ever   when super mario 64 launched with the n64 it was indeed a very revolutionary game it was the first game to present 3d platforming state of the art graphics and some of funnest best gameplay you 'll see in platforming action games   the game is huge   in mario 64 you will be going through many many stages to collect stars so you can unlock more areas for more stars and ultimatley put the evil bowser to an end and once again save princes peach   i was one of many people who first played this game back when it launched with the nintendo 64 and when you compare it to todays games the game(to many but not me)looks terrible but you got ta understand the time this game was released(96')it was infact the best looking video game ever ..... period ... and even today when i play this classic it still looks amazing   call me crazy but i seriously still think this is one of the best looking video games of not only the mid 90 's but even today it is still marvalous   the music in mario 64 was just plain perfect the music blended in with the games levels and star hunting words can not explain how well miyamoto and nintendo did for the music it 's just plain good   the controls are also tight and well focused i especially love the array of moves mario has and although the controls may feel abit clumsy at times it never bothered me once   as for camera yes there were times were i wanted to break the tv but the reward and satisfaction of getting a star after that trouble feels so good   audio controls graphics are all a+ and as for gameplay? ... well it depends .. do you like platforming action exploring collecting games because you will be collecting pretty much for the whole game(stars duuhhh)and if the answer is yes then this may be the best game you 've ever played   now for me the gameplay was truly fun and innovative i never got bored once in this game   it 's so fun hunting for stars never gets annoying or frustraiting   speaking of difficulty the game is perfect it 's not hard nor is it easy like pie(acctually i take that back for many people this game will be easy if you wanna just beat the plot)but it just gets it right on difficulty i do n't remember ever being frusraited or angry with the game(then again i never did try to get all 120 stars)and just having a great time with the game ... it seriously is one of the funnest experiences i 've ever had with a game and as i said before .... this game is revolutionary   now that i 'm done ranting and talking about this game i 'll just get to it quickly ... the good one of the best and most revolutionary game ever .. period back then and even today it is still one of the best looking video games ever made loads of things to do not hard but not too easy it 's juuuust about right the game is just plain fun the moves the platforming collecting ect collecting stars is really fun!-the music in this game is just plain fun to listen to!!-though the bosses are easy i still think they 're just classics!-will take a very long time to get all 120 stars and collecting 120 stars means spending lots of time with this amazing title the worlds and places you visit are all so different and an amazment to look atthe bad some may feel that game is feeling abit dated now(the game is pretty old now!!)-some will find the graphics to be terrible or just bad which i find hard to believe people who just want to beat the games plot and nothing els should n't even touch the game(because the game does n't take too long to beat for plot and if you 're planning on not having a fun time with the game and just wanting to beat the game and getting it over with what 's the point of that?)-some will be angry with the camera alot of people today or in the future may get this game and probably nag about how easy the bosses are well cry me a river if you want a hardboss go play something els .... other then that get ready to play one of the best games ever ... overall super mario 64 stands up on its own   the game was indeed revolutionary and braught us amazing visuals superb gameplay and great controlls aswell as a fun adventure like plot with lots of collecting to do   the games music was just great to listen to the places the game takes you are just so fun and innovative and the moves mechanics that are enabled for mario(though limited)are great   the game is just plain great   as i stated before it is one of the best video games ever made and it indeed gets a perfect5 out of 5 stars .....
the mario series from nintendo has consistently produced games that are refreshing and innovative not to mention extremely addictive and fun to play   first there was the original super mario brothers and super matio brothers 3 for the nes to super mario world for the snes and now super mario 64 for the n64   the game is 5 years old now but it 's still just as fun to play as ever   the graphics and sound make excellent use of the n64 's capabilities to create a 3d world that was just jaw dropping in 1996 and is still pretty awesome today as others have said the basic story of the game is classic mario   bowser has kidnapped the princess and mario must rescue her   to do this he must collect a minimum of 70 stars from the 15 worlds in the game   these worlds are accessed by jumping through paintings and other objects scattered throughout the mushroom castle plus there are 15 stars contained within the castle itself   although you only need 70 stars to finish the game there are a total of 120 stars available for collection and you wo n't be satisfied until you have collected each one   the 15 worlds have varying levels of difficulty but each and every world has some easy stars and some that are very difficult   it took me about 100 hours total to collect all 120 stars and rescue the princess the first time   each level has a different theme   some are on mountains some are in water filled caves and there is one set inside a giant clock   my personal favorite is the haunted house level the gameplay in mario 64 is exceptional   mario has many different types of moves ranging from tiptoeing around sleeping enemies to a great long jump to a very difficult to master wall jump   you must master all the moves if you expect to get all 120 stars   also there are three special hats scattered throughout the game that allow mario to fly walk underwater and become invisible   again all are vital for 120 stars after you finally win you might expect that you will never want to take on such a huge task again   but such is not the case   even though you have all 120 stars you can go back to levels you have beaten and play them over and over as much as you want   you 'll be tempted to do just that   the experience of playing through the incredible world of the mushroom castle is such that you will be coming back for many repeat visits
this is easily the best game i 've ever played   i played it back when it was first released for the n64 and at the time there was nothing else like it on any of the other platforms it led the way for 3d gaming which is of course the norm now   to this day i still get nostalgic and pop the cartridge in on occasion just to run around in the various worlds the graphics still look pretty good and the game play is still fun   a simply incredible game
what a great game i like it alot the only problems i found were:1 it gives off way too many hints to how to complete a puzzle or beat a boss(example on the first time you fight bowser he says can you get behind me and grab my tail i think not!"2 moving around is kinda stupid because mario ca n't move to the different direction fast enough and he slips on the floor when he moves other than these flaws this is a solid title that deserves to be in your collection
right off the bat before it came out you 'd probably wonder how would you ever imagine mario in 3d. well here 's your answer mario 64.there 's 15 huge courses with 7 missions in each counting 100 coin stars with stars for rewards those stars help you unlock more levels at the time no one ever saw anything like this before although the graphics look fairly primitive now they were still eye candy for most mario fans especially back then super mario 64 plays how a 3d game should be played like with a free camera flawless control and extremely playable environments getting all 120 stars is the real challenge spoiler alert if you do manage to get them all you get to visit yoshi on the castle roof and he will give you 100 lives along with an improved triple jump move overall you know what i want you to do so do it buy the game
i d like to say this game is surprisingly easy(thats a good thing if you play all the cards right i got in july of this year and beat it today the game has great visuals and music and i ca nt be the only one who feels a tinge of sadness when the screen says the end i get the feeling not because its a disappointment(it is nt at all but because it was a real great game with a real great story thats also why i like playing it again and again nintendo 64 is nt the best nintendo system of all time that title belongs to game cube but mario 64 is one of the greatest games ever made i feel anxious to put more n64 games into my collection ones like ocarina of time banjo kazooie and majora 's mask the n64 was slightly disappointing because there just are nt enough quality games for it but i d be lying if i said it does nt have at least 4 classics still the time has come for you to get a game cube namco 's museum is out for it so is super mario sunshine metroid prime sonic mega collection star fox adventures super smash bros melee resident evil super monkey ball 1 and 2 and upcoming attractions dont be afraid to buy a new nintendo system but remember to keep the n 64 always
a fun game all the way you just ca n't get enough of this fantastic wonderful game
love it the kids love it and its not xbox 360 lol moms and dads and some grand parents would love it too
this is it the ground breaking game that shot the nintendo 64 sells thorough the roof and off to space super mario 64 is a game that ca nt be found anywhere else it is truly amazing in every aspect from stunning graphics to superbly versatile gameplay i just could nt believe that this game could be this good even though it is so old!(yes it is old now this game was so dang much fun that they even made it for nintendo ds if you are looking for one amazing game and own the best system ever made(nintendo 64-not xbox playstsion 2 or xbox 360 then look for super mario 64 you will not be dissapointed guaranteed
we had this game before and as the years went by it became defective after searching and searching it finally became available and we had to get it
my six year old grandson has had many hours of enjoyment especiall after receiving this cartridge and his console which shipped in another order everything was smooth and merchandise arrived in excellent condition and in time prescribed
this game is fun but do n't expect a classic super mario game this one is way diffrent than any other mario game before it but still great in it 's own way
this is a great classic game that basically revolutionized nintendo 64 but there is only one problem it is way too easy to beat but i guess since it 's an old game i can see why basically the mission is to recover all the 120 stars and save the princess from the evil bowser it 's really easy and you can beat the game in about a month even though i have plenty of nintendo games i still go back to this game once in awhile because it 's a classic favorite many current nintendo games ca n't compete against it if only this game was a bit more challenging i think all new nintendo 64 buyers should get this as there first game because you can explore alot with controls and skills that 'll help you out in more challenging games any fans of mario or nintendo genre would like this game as far as kids there is n't much violence in this game no blood or gorey actions the price is pretty ok and the game 's plot is pretty ok there are many courses and places to explore so if you are a slow player it 'll take some time after you complete the game you 'll still be going back to it seeing that my brothers and i already beat it over 10 times we 're finally getting tired of it
stupid sony ... they forced 3d games out before anybody was ready nintendo was forced to cancel many super nintendo games doom fx star fox 2 mario fx and release the nintendo 64 many popular 2d games failed in full 3d. castlevania mega man ... they failed and have not been revived did mario succeed yes this game is a legend i heard about it in 2009 not 1996 in a nintendo power magazine simply titled mario i did not own a nintendo 64 this was 2009 the only system i had was an original wii that we used for mario kart i was somehow able to persaude my parents to buy me a wii point card with 2000 points on it enough for mario 64 and super mario bros 3 i downloaded it and was greeted with a happy mario face that said hello soon i was distorting him to where he had no moustache and had big ears then i started the game and got a message from peach in her girly princess voice she read the letter which told mario she had baked a cake for him the plumber could not resist and jumped out of a warp pipe onto the castle grounds i had never played a 3d mario game i stuck to animal crossing mario kart my sims and wii sports i was 8 years old after a little bit of exploring i entered the castle instead of a cake mario got a scary message from bowser who ate cake i guess soon i was hiking up a hill to meet a giant king bomb complete with a moustache and crown he told me using fancy king words that in order to get the bomb i had to defeat him i defeated him and moved on to the next level a giant fortress ran by slabs of concrete with faces then i started level 3 a snow level what a level that was finding baby penguins building snowmen sliding down a slide then my parents walked in my mom said yuck what are those dots supposed to be those dots were snow flakes my dad said are those graphics ... 64 bit i had not even realized the graphics were bad because i was lost in the creative levels each level had an original design with interesting puzzles and obstacles put in the way of the star each boss was different and interesting the graphics are outdate so what this along with mario 3 really changed my view of video games now in 2012 i have almost no respect for high powered consoles like the xbox 360 kids should play these old games how hard is it to get kids a 20 card so that they can enjoy a unique classic like this the challenge is not too much if you get stuck on one level you can try another this is a beautiful game that put the nintendo 64 to its limits
when this game came out it was like a historic event   it felt like there was no longer a limit to what video games could do   every toy store had a booth set up where you could give this game a try   it was amazing to play and amazing to see this game is still amazing   the play control is amazingly smooth and you can make mario do some unbelievable things   the worlds are amazing   you can go wherever you want to go do whatever you want to do just look at the difference between this game and the original super mario bros. for nes   my gosh the difference is astounding   it 's amazing how nintendo could take something so great and make it hundreds of times better in less than two decades   sometimes i love progress
when super mario 64 was released ten years ago it was instantly the best video game ever created simply put playing this game was a magical imagination mind opening experience almost a mystical one in fact this euphoric feeling and sense of awe that we felt the first time we played this game would never again be matched at least up until this stage in the video game realm what made it so amazing was the fact that mario who had only existed in 3d in our minds as kids had now become like the cartoon character we watched on the super mario brothers cartoon the days of nintendo 's rule were the great ones in video games and it 's a shame that kids nowadays wo n't get to grow up with mario like us generation x ers every mario game for me was truly magical but super mario 64 was truly revelatory i spent years of my life playing this game literally and still play it more today than another other game available for any other system unfortunately this was one of the few true masterpieces for the nintendo 64 and sony took over with the playstation for me however nintendo and mario are what video games are all about and super mario 64 was the pinnacle of the entire industry
one of the best games of its time and is still considered by many to be one of the best games ever made i highly recommed this game
i remember the first time i laid eyes on this game i had been hearing about how awesome the nintendo 64 was going to be from schoolmates as we eagerly anticipated the usa release of this system i remember hearing how in demand it was and the ensuing shortage for the upcoming christmas before i even saw it then one day i was christmas shopping with my dad and happened to come across a demo set up in the mall and i finally got to see what the massive hype was about the game was bright and colorful and mario was fully 3d. a large crowd had gathered around to catch a glimpse of the latest in video game technology and i only lingered for a moment yet my first impression is still fresh in my memory mario 64 looked like nothing i had ever seen before and also looked leaps and bounds better than anything i had ever seen on playstation sega saturn or any other system i was very impressed several months later i finally saved up enough money to purchase the system bundled with mario 64 i loved the game dearly back then and to this day i still love this game it still looks feels and plays unlike any other game that came out during that era while zelda ocarina of time is similar graphics wise that game is so great in it 's own right that both games deserve to be recognized separately mario 64 is a perfect launch game for the nintendo 64 home console system looking at the controller for the n64 one might have been understandably skeptical due to the layout however mario 64 is actually very easy to control and is a good introduction to getting gamer 's accustomed to the new feel of the controller and it 's new button layout when i say the controls for this game are very simple i must also mention that mario is capable of many actions mario can walk run crawl jump triple jump backflip side somersault wall kick swim climb punch kick slide fly shoot from a cannon butt splash hang hand over hand crouch surf on koopa shells and even look around while this scope of actions seems like a lot and likely difficult to master the reality is that yes it is alot but is not difficult at all to master a few of the skills such as wall kicking or flying take some practice to master but the majority of mario 's actions are very easy to master which results in very fluid gameplay and the sensation of actually being mario the camera angles are manageable considering you have control over them you might find yourself slightly frustrated with it in certain enclosed areas such as boo 's haunted house but for the most part the camera angles are very functional the gameplay is extremely fun with a very gradual learning curve while you only need 60 stars to complete the game players looking to one up the challenge can elect to try and collect all 120 stars which requires true mastery of the game the music is outstanding koji kondo also famous for the ocarina of time music did all the music for mario 64 and succeeded in composing very memorable and enjoyable tunes my personal favorite is and will always be the jolly rodger bay dire dire docks music the level design is unique with some truly large levels offering tons of exploration mario will find himself in sunken ships caves with toxic gas inside a volcano a pyramid in a desert a fortress in the sky sliding down slippery snowy slopes and even inside a giant strange clock this game is filled with fun challenges and hours of terrific gameplay i do n't believe i 've ever met anyone that did n't find this game fun to play no luigi is not in the game there was a major hoax citing ridiculous methods that would unlock luigi but all proved untrue kind of strange luigi was n't in the game but not that big of a deal mario 64 is well loved and remembered but it is kind of strange that the nintendo 64 's launch game is almost incomparable to the entire library of games that followed super mario world on super nintendo was a gem but there were other great games in the snes library however with the nintendo 64 super mario 64 along with zelda ocarina of time stand head and shoulders above pretty much every game in the nintendo 64 library which is disappointing considering that we see the nintendo 64 was capable of supporting top notch games the nintendo 64 library just did n't manage to produce games that lived up to the original launch game in the end mario 64 will always be remembered as the revolutionary classic that literally defined the nintendo 64-bit era
15 years later still a great game this is a classic in every sense of the word it not only redefined the mario franchise it redefined 3d gaming it is a must have it you still own a n64
i found this game to be a challenge at first used to the old side scrolling games of mario it took some time to get used to the fact its now in 3d.if you like mario you will love thi 3d game
register now!usernameby now many mario fans have taken a look at either the japanese or u.s. version of super mario 64 so we 'll spare you most of the hype and rhetoric having said that it must be stated that sm64 is the greatest videogame to date and one which all games regardless of genre will be judged henceforth nintendo set itself a nearly impossible goal and achieved it with sm64 look closely mario 's lineage is 2d -- not ideal material upon which to base the most intensely scrutinized 3d videogame ever but videogames are in the end meant to entertain and entertainment is at the heart of this fantastic title like many previous mario games experimentation is integral to the experience of playing you must explore everything leave no rock unturned no mushroom mute no door unopened mario himself has so many possible movements and the environment is so intensely interactive that even the least experimental players will spend hours on the first level without achieving anything in particular the game is initially less accessible than previous mario titles although the three pronged analog controller is n't really where the difficulty lies -- the joypad itself performs excellently overall the biggest obstacle in the game is finding the correct viewpoint the camera which moves on its own unless directed manually by using the four gold buttons tries to find the optimal angle to view the action though occasionally you 're simply not able to see where you 're going additionally frustration sets in as you spin the camera around while simultaneously attempting to run across a moving plank or tip toeing across a tiny ledge but getting the hang of sm64 is all a matter of practice and as soon you catch on you will execute these skills unconsciously the variety of levels and scale each world is simply breathtaking the game consists of 15 massive courses in which mario can attain seven stars per course with numerous secret areas and bonuses including 15 extra stars for a total or 120 stars it 'll surely take the average gamer 60 hours to reach the third and final bowser and free the princess not to mention find yoshi so the game 's replay value is bountiful and despite all of their saccharin sweet cuteness the graphics are magnificent shigeru miyamoto 's dream of producing an interactive cartoon has been fully realized -- the animation is lavish the textures rich and even the most superfluous touches have been completely executed sm64 is not perfect however despite the efficiency of the hardware 's load management draw in is noticeable and occasionally gamers will look right through walls or objects still this is as close to perfection a game has ever been 64-bit no less super mario 64 also puts nintendo 's preference of quot;silicon over cds&quot to the test with pleasingly familiar results most owners of either a saturn or a playstation or both have by now acclimated to long load times though grumblingly super mario 64 will remind them of how gaming used to be load time is nil and reaching a playable level is only a matter of seconds from the time you switch on the unit until you 're done the flow is seamless and moving from one game area to another is instantaneous nintendo 's musical prodigy koji kondo turns in an inspired performance somehow finding room on the small cartridge to create the appropriate music for each world even though some tracks are cheesy others like the sitar laden score of the first fire level are more than effective in setting the mood for the level and are as atmospheric as any redbook audio also impressive are the sound effects mario 's onscreen antics are matched by grunts whoops and hollers fleshing out his spunky personality as a whole the flagship n64 game more than makes up for any painful delay or delays imposed upon the unit 's release sm64 is complete in every way and the challenging experience of working toward each new level is far greater than the game 's minimal flaws nintendo 's craftsmanship and zeal for creating fantastically enjoyable games has never shown through more than in super mario 64 nintendo 64 's early flagship title demonstrates the power of the hardware as well as the creative genius of miyamoto and team not only does the game obliterate every platformer before it in terms of visual finesse it plays just as well if not infinitely better than previous 2d incarnations of the mario franchise 3d worlds are huge and cleverly laid out so that there 's never a dull moment secrets play a huge part of the experience recapturing the classic gameplay style of the series in fact this game is exactly as one might hope it would be mario in 3d. more freedom more space more options better graphics improved and elaborated control schemes -- it 's all there possibly the greatest videogame achievement ever do n't rent buy
great graphics good gameplay if you want a challenging game get this one its kinda hard it 'll keep you busy for a couple of weeks
this game is great i played a friends and then they gave it to me .. i ve beat it i still have to try to get all the stars but i will the game is real fun and interactive with many great lands and levels to get the stars and fun bosses the game is just really great i really love it it rocks
super mario 64(1997 when i first got nintendo 64,it came with super mario 64.when the system was hooked up i put in the game and was amazed on how the graphics were!it was excellent the graphics were great the music was cool and mario never looked better!this game is for everyone i thought banjo kazooie was a great game but move over banjo mario is back!the best game ever features new worlds characters setting and do n't worry some of the old villians from the early mario games are here and ca n't forget bowser and princess toadstool(peach).better than any 64 game ever made
i love this game i have overall like i said 4 out of 5 highly recommend it to anyone who loves great games and platformers
why is this on the list because for the time it was the cream of the crop and its also one of the funnest mario games you 'll ever play the worlds look great lots of free roaming and neverending gameplay is why this game makes the list still love it
super mario 64 is one of the best games ever it 's a classic no mario fan should be without it now onto the reveiw controls:9.5/10it 's pretty good compaired to some games but most games have much smoother control but since this is one of the first n64 games i 'm going to give it a good rating considering there are no ps2s gcs or xboxs there 's mario 's famous jump double jump and triple jump the double and triple jumps can be performed by timing when you press the a button there is also the groundpound aka buttstomp and other confusing jumps also mario can pick up and throw various items climb walls using the wall jump and punch and kick the reson why this game 's getting a 9.5 is because some jumps can be hard to master and controlling mario can sometimes be hard graphics:10/10like i said this is one of the first nintendo 64 games!so it 's okay that the graphics are a little blocky and not very detailed the graphics are very well done replay value:7/10the point of the game is to retrieve all of the castle 's power stars and save princess peach there are 120 in all you only need 70 to beat the game sure it 's fun to go back and beat the game a couple more times but how much time are you going to spend getting all 120?some stars are very hard to get and after a couple of times you might get frusterated and just give up!overall:10/10super mario 64 is a brilliant game mario can be turned into metal mario invisible and fly by wearing special caps that last a certain amount of time he can shoot from cannons and swing bowser around by the tail the courses are cleverly designed everything is almost perfect i use the word almost because nothing is perfect
perhaps sc3 k 's main problem is that it is far too detailed even on a speedy top end machine the screen will fill with portions of white if you try to scroll at one of higher resolutions perhaps this is also sc3 k 's   main virtue the fact that you can see down to the last person in your   metropolis whatever you say despite the game 's vast graphical and   not so vast strategic advances it failed to do what the fans of the series   held closest to their hearts personalization the city develops   completely at random within your zonal confines you can not make a   candleshop district a downtown or anything of the sort you can not name   streets despite the fact that you place them yourself the papers mention   you rarely and glancingly at best preferring to metion senseless rock   bands whose names you can not supply either or some other uneventful   thing the advisors are as helpful as ever specifically useless they   either take no notice of the trouble befalling your city or they take   notice of something very minor and blow it up to the size of a scandal the   1 commercial tax is killing the city   remove the parking fines   all   the while industry fails to develop and a major power outage goes   unnoticed this game is a cleaner crisper version of simcity 2000   perhaps an update but in no way a new game in the series
i enjoy playing this game for the most part i have spent hours glued to the computer watching my cities grow unfortunately as the cities increase in population so does the chances of the computer crashing a very annoying problem also the parades last too long the seaports are difficult to develop the terrain for some cities such as st. louis are unusually hilly and the buildings look alike the game is not that challenging but overall a recommended game
ever since i got this game i 've loved it i lost it so i recently had to buy another one but you get the hang of things pretty quickly ... very very fun game
i started my first succesful city w/o a starter city and it was great then after about two hours of gameplay my 855,500 pop city had a problem with people it must have because in less than 20 minuets my city was reduced to about 250,000 pop get this it was for no apparent reason my popularity was high all of the ordenances i could have had were activated all buildings had water and power i had full funding to schools firestations police ect police and fire coverage were excelant taxes were only at 3 for everything ind. com and res and everything else you could think of i had it it was the perfect city and my whole population who still liked by the way left the city if you have a good reason for it i 'd say it was a glitch in the game do n't get me wrong it is a fun game when there is a reason to the sudden drops but i do n't think you can have a real good city that lasts for more than four or five hours and there is no good city they 'll all die out eventually the only option you have is loss i am hoping that sc 4000 will be much better
sim city 3000 is good game yet it is the hardest game i have ever played the main problem is getting money i can never get any profit at the end of each year sure i can use the 100,000 cheat code but it only works once another problem is getting the people to work even if you put residential areas where they live next to industrial areas where they work they still might complain that it is too far to go some good things about sim city 3000 is that you can build famous landscapes also the graphics are great if you are considering buying this city building game i would suggest the sims or roller coaster tycoon instead
talk about being able to play a game forever this seems to be the case with sc3000   this game is well done with many features controls interfaces and ultimately complete control for you the mayor   i have played this game over and over and built incredible cities like new san francisco   i know you will experience tons of fun when you buy this one
making a city it 's a change for once i like this game because it gives easy control and it 's fun to play there are some down sides to it too like it takes too long to make a big city and sims complain tooooo much but it 's all good other then that my favorite thing to do is save the city then rip it down by disteasters the good thing is you do n't have to save it after you destory it this game can be easy or hard like if you want to make a big city it takes time and it 's hard but if you use codes like i am weak call coison vinnie i love red tape power to the masses water in the desert garage in garage out and nardz rool(actually spelling it 's eazy ... graphics well it is n't that good on making small sims but good on everything else 9/10 fun a very fun game is n't has fun as some games but it 's cool,7/10 gameplay well if you like making cities then it has long gameplay 8.5/10 sound i really like the sound because it makes me think more,9.5/10 overall you would love this game but it 's fun is n't like some games 8.5/10 which is great awesome and 4 stars for sim city 3000
i 'll admit right now that i hate all of the simcities that came out with the exception of the super nintendo version of the first simcity   i 'm more of an action person not a sit back and watch my city grow person   sure   simcity 3000 is good for a while with it 's catchy graphics and innovative   approach to buidling a city but a few hours later you 'll either want to   fall asleep or put your fist through the monitor depending upon whether   the income for your city is positive or negative for each game year   i   turned out to be one of the latter people   no matter how hard i tried i   could never get the income to come out positive   so i did what any   distraught and stuck person would do ... go online for cheat codes   an hour   later i was bored   if you 're a thinker by all means try simcity 3000   out   but if you 're a person that thinks actions speak louder than words   try dungeon keeper 2 a game like simcity 3000 but not as complex and   more active
while the game itself is quite good   i enjoy playing my copy of the game and still find new interest and challenges of running cities   the replay value should be obvious as there is no quot;end goal&quot to meet though there are quot;rewards&quot along the way   there are several problems however particularly when compared to sim city 2000   first there are no scenarios   that is a pity because the scenarios often enhanced the value of the game   second you can not for your own landform in the new city mode before you start the game again unlike sc2000   both of these problems were later corrected for the later cousin of the game sim city 3000 unlimited additionally the online support is much better for unlimited   the building downloads on the official website are minimal and the building design tool is not supported by the basic game   still i will have to admit that 3000 is still a vast improvement over the previous version   the buildings are better designed and they really do look different on different sides   also the graphics are much better over 2000 while they are not vastly improved in unlimited which is essentially the same game with the additions above and additional buildings   i would recommend that you do buy unlimited over this version simply because of the vast number of updates   and with the release of sim city 4 it is highly unlikely that even the unlimited website will stay up much into the future and it certainly will not be supported any more
at first glance this game may look easy but its not you could spend many hours just trying to figure out what everything does and even more making your numerous attempts at unsuccesful cities the graphics are pretty good   but you need an intense system for the game to run smoothly maxis has once   again added their own humorous touch to the game which can add to the fun   factor you probably wo n't get sick of this game very fast if you are   looking for a huge improvement over sc2 k you wo n't find it here i have made   this game sound bad but it really is n't this a very fun and challenging   game and would reccomend it only to one who likes this particular genre
sim city 3000 is great for people looking for a game that is fun pulls you in mildly addictive and not too complex the unlimited version only offers more building sets and other things that some people would pay for but nothing relavent from 1 to 1oo this game would get a 40 why becuase it just isn that good of a game i 'm an expert ing gaming and pcs and have been in the business since windows 95 but this game is made for the average dumb american that is why it is so simple and lacks any depth this game is perfect for teenagers soccer moms and stud people but anybody who likes a good challenging game should n't even look in it 's direction these are the good things about the game .... 1 it has playability value but not much from 1 to 10 maybe a 3 becuase once you master it spoiler it takes about a hundred years to get a size million in a city you just do n't give a damn about playing it again.2 system requirements are low and it runs on the most ancient pc that is feasible.3 it 's easy to learn to play and inexpensive and the graphics are pretty good for those who care unless you get to close highest zoom).4 you can voyage out of reality and build a city of imagination now these are the concerns about the game.1 the game has very little realistic qualities about it it is not in check with the real word even the information bar suggest it was mad for kids.2 there is no names for streets no district and area setting and no combining indidvidual parks to make one small medium or large park different small or large parks placed to getting but functioning different ans seperate is not realistic).3 there are not as many tax forms as they are in the real world and the maps are either way too small or only show the central part of the city which is also unrealistc since all large cities have metros.4 the max loan size is way too small and the interest is a bit extreme.5 the airports do n't generate as much income as they should.6 there are not nearly enough mass transit options in the game and the availabe ones are very unrealistic the train option is just horrific and the subway us expensive and not very fun to build they were probably thinking that the game is about cit building but transportation is a huge part of any city over 300,000 the highways are basicly useless and very expensive and difficult to build and there are no underground building and other types of roads and highways and no street lights and signs.7 it is just about impossible to get a city size of over 4 million even on the larget plot availabe and even when thinking this is just the central part of a city and the metro is not shown on map is still not feasible since the large us cities have far more than 5million people in there central part.8 the game crashes and is racked with bugs.all in all you see why this game gets a 40 if less this game is not just that great hopefully they will fix atleast 60 percent of these major flaws(anything less is unacceptable in the next simcity and as for simcity 4 lets not just go there and there will not be a five i believe maxis is not in operation anymore and has just not announced it but the city simulation industry is still wide open and the demand is high
when you first buy this game you will need to give it time reading the   manual first just might be alot of help the game starts out in pause mode   this gives you time to zone space for roads residental amp commercial or   indutry zones water pipes and electrical wires it times take to know the   best way to zone rcis it 's not easy and money can disappear fast so do n't   go crazy zoning everything and destorying things it will cost you it sum   this review in one sentence it takes time to build a perfect city so try   different approaches and eventually your get it right
first off let me clear up some misstatements about the features listed above by amazon.com:*realistic 3-d environmentwrong the game is 2d it merely looks 3d. it is realistic however there is far more detail in   2d than could ever have been done in 3d and still hae it run on everyone 's   machine.*view cities from up to 50,000 feeti guess ... you have 5 zoom   levels the above implies that you can zoom to any level.*detailed   control over businesses and other facilitiesnone whatsoever other than   being able to zone blocks of residential commercial and industrial areas   along with other specialized zones you ca n't micromanage any individual   businesses.*everything and everyone movescars and simcitizens move   so do some animated buildings but certainly not everything.*optional   load in sets for customization and enhancementsthat 's handled much   better in sc3 k unlimited simcity 3000 is a mixed bag for me i love   being able to play a fully updated version of 2000 but whether it should   be called 3000 or 2100 is something of a dilemma graphics wise 3000 is   beautiful no two ways about it a lot of hype has gone into the fact that   you can now zoom in and see little sims walking driving around in   individual cars and so on the building images are now fully 4-sided   entities so that rotating the view yields 4 different looks at each   feature five zoom levels let you choose the size you 're comfortable with   to build on some people claim that the buildings are blocky and pixellated   at the highest zoom i do n't have that problem but they are definitely not   the crisp renders that the other 4 zooms are they are merely enlargements   of the 4th zoom vehicles and pedestrians remain crisp and distinct at any   zoom gameplay here 's the sticking point for me if you 've continued to   play simcity 2000 until you 're red eyed and guaranteed to be late for   work school you 'll probably do the same with 3000 given all the new bells   and whistles it 'll take some time to try them all and see how this affects   that from this point however two camps emerge one camp will continue   playing the game for years and loving every minute of it relishing the   freedom to create anything they want i fall into this category the other   camp once having seen everything and mastered building megalopoli at will   are going to wonder what 's the fun anymore so depending on your   expectations for the game it 'll be either a gift from heaven or something   you may well have wished did n't cost 40 to 50 bucks as for difficulty   it 's no harder really than 2000 some of the new features like garbage   disposal ordinances and neighboring city dealings add depth and strategy   without making the game unduly complex maxis should be commended for   that overall it 's good in fact it 's very good they put a lot of work   into it making sure everything balances more or less is it worth the   money not now with sc3 k unlimited out get it instead as it 's much more   refined if you have n't played a simcity game before or if you 're a diehard   2000 fan absolutely if you just sorta liked 2000 and quit playing it   after a little bit you may want to wait until it hits the bargain rack
i can play this game comfortably on my old xp machine without a special video card that 's worth a lot in my book not to mention the joy of spending most of my gaming time building rather than destroying however if you want you can sick all kinds of crises and destroy the city if you want .... sometimes that 's fun this is a great strategy game
i love sim games very much but i did not like this sim game   after i would have my little city all set up i would need to watch it like a hawk leaving me with almost no time to expand and improve on my little city   i have been told to give this game another try but i just can not find a reason to go back and try this game again
sim city 3000 is really cool   you start off by making a power plant(i prefer fusion or microvave),laying power lines zoning residentail commercail and industrial areas disposing of garbage making roads and/or a mass transit system make water structures and pipelines and take care of civic needs   later in the game you might want to enact some ordinances(rules laws),make business deals with neighbors and organizations set a budget(earlier on the computer does it for you),build rewards which most of them can only be optained thru business deals ones optained without deal county courthouse mayoral mansion also know as you 're house city hall performing of arts center and monument statue ones optained thru deal gigamall amusement park space port defense contractor country golf club etc   plus you can add landmarks to you 're city   this is a great game but for sim city 2000 fans that want a totaly different game get the unlimited version(also known as sim city 3000 unlimited
simcity 3000 is a good simulation   the graphics are outstanding the music is ok it is fun to look down and see vehicles driving on the streets and the people walking around   even the sound effects match with the specific area of the city you are looking at   for example high crime residential areas feature sporadic gunfire rapid footsteps and the clanging of a chain link fence   the bustling commercial areas feature heavy traffic noises and sirens and industrial areas have heavy truck and machinery noises   you control the layout of the streets and the zoning   then the city develops itself according to land values and access to transportation the not so good   when areas become blighted and buildings are abandoned the buildings become black boarded up boxes that no longer resemble the original building style-- for example a twelve story apartment building when abandoned becomes a three story black box with boarded up windows   you can not have suspension bridges cross above highways or city streets   all the streets intersect no way to build overpasses except highways crossing streets there is no way to build elevated rail lines-- the railroad must cross every street at an intersection   also you are mostly restricted to a north south street grid systemoverall this is a great game   i just felt like pointing out some flaws that might annoy some people
the only shump on the 64 i figured i 'd check it out ... it plays like a genesis game with crude 3d backgrounds not very interesting to look at if you want shump there 's only one system for you and it 's called the dreamcast this one you can pass on
one of my all time favorites for the n64 in my opinion one of the best looking games for the system if you like the genre and you 're interested in playing older games pick this one up i know this game wo n't make many people 's short list however if you are into spaceships lasers and are a huge nerd you 'll know you 'll like it if you are not a fan of shooters do n't pick it up
star soldier is very reminiscient of older scroll side to side games but once you 've experienced the graphics and the newer style of play ex starfox it is somewhat antiquated   the levels of difficulty are easy to navigate but the variety of scenery and the gameplay is very oldschool and plays itself out quickly   overall i would recommend it for those who want to play the old style but i would n't rate it better than the starfox series or other flying games to date
i did n't know that star soldiers is a remake from the early nintendo game you can check it out on youtube first if you like its a vertical 2d shooter great game
i 've had a great time with this one you can pick from 3 alternative but well balanced ships play with a comfortable control scheme rake high scores and combos use powerful special weapons collect and preserve power ups by staying alive deflect shots by doing rolls and are complimented with a remarkable engaging soundtrack the power ups are what make this game stand out because the ships seem to upgrade almost endlessly until you 're firing more powerful and voluminous attacks i mentioned the controls before between the d pad rolling with the right shoulder button firing special attacks with the left shoulder and b buttons and keeping hold on the a button and firing strategically to maintain a shot combo it 's fun and easy to use that being said the missions in vanishing earth are n't easy by any means because you need to avoid hitting ships as well as being fired on and the bosses are particularly adept at relentlessly firing at you however players are offered consolation in that they can continue from the beginning of the mission after losing and can store a password if they 'd like personally i enjoy staring over from the beginning so i can keep all the power ups i earn and even if you do n't want to play the whole game there 's a fast 2 or 5 minute arcade style mode where you earn as high a score as you can destroying enemy vessels with maximum power upgrade from the start i had a lot of fun switching off with a friend but it 's good for single player as well not as flawless as super star soldier and i mean that particularly with regard to the visuals of the area you fly over not being as outstanding but overall it still looks good enough not to harm the fun vanishing earth is also much easier to collect for than its turbografx counterpart if you can get the cartridge around 15 20 dollars i say go for it because there 's hours of enjoyable content that will leave you coming back for more
this game is amazing the music makes you look forward to every fight and the pace does n't let you blink and yet you feel the artwork and the location you 're at you 've got three highly distinct ships to use list of them in order of difficulty easy red ship spread shot gatling gun that gets more shots in per level but power never truly upgrades medium blue ship powerful pulse laser punches straight through enemies and it gains spread upon the final level up hard green ship spread shot eventually reaches a strategic half moon shape that makes every shot count it 's a shame that no other arcade shooters exist on the n64 it could 've had other great games like raystorm and g darius in a heartbeat
well there s tons of different levels and stages you can go through.each fighter has his own special powers.before you get started you ll need to inject caffiene directly into your thumbs to keep up with the computer guy.at first you should take lou kang.hes the easiest guy to learn.everythings easy once your caffiene kicks in up un til you run into goro.hes not even the boss but he s the toughest guy by far on every level.hes a big huge guy who can kill you in like 5 hits.when you hit him it barely fazes him.just do something repeatedly like raiden[theres a real japanese god called raiden and his torpedo spear or quan chis tele stomp.the fatalities are very gruesome.one involves a guy ripping off the other dudes leg and then beating him to death with it.ps for some stupid reason all the cs are ks in this game
i did not play this on n64 but i did play it in the arcade it is such a wonderful and awesome game it is not even the least bit funny the graphics rock the arenas are both cool looking and interesting there are many cool moves each of the fighters have and the endings are movies i have won this game four times all four as none other than scorpion my favorite mk fighter(4 times i won mk4 perfect fit i love this game it is cooler than nearly any game i know there are some of the coolest fighters ever along with scorpion in it and i plan to get it for my computer period
despite mixed emotions from reviewers all over mortal kombat 4 is an awesome fighting game taking the once 2-d game into 3-d now adds alot of depth the game moves just as smoothly and as fast as the past games so those who still have the twitch when it comes to fighting games will feel right at home i remember when i played this at the arcade at our local mall when it first came out i went up against a 12 year old kid and got my tail kicked by him on it but i was tickled to just get to play it i 'm tickled it 's out for the systems definitely worth checking out collect it if you can
this was my a;ll time favorite both on the arcade and at home great classic as far as fighting games went back in it 's time works wonderfully thanks so much
i like nintendo 64 also i really enjoy watching the mortal kombat movies and playing the mortal kombat games yeah
the very first 3d mortal kombat offers great graphics new 3d worlds the return of several fighters tournaments 2 on 2 kombat and much more scorpion goro reptile and others return to the game with a few new fighters however the bad part is that all of the new characters have similar powers as the old characters that were not in the game another bad part is that unlike the past few mortal kombat games is that this game is very quick to beat and it lacks challenge to make up for it though there are the most awesome fatalities of any game such as scorpion 's very realistic fire the spinal removal from sub zero with a total 3d effect and liu kang 's throwing his opponent straight toward the camera each fighter now has weapons as well to add flavor to the fight
now i 'll be reviewing mortal kombat 4 which is hated by some some do like it they the mk team was trying to change it with the times i 'll admit it 's not as good as mortal kombat ii 3 ultimate mortal kombat 3 or mortal kombat trilogy it has it 's problems but i like it mk 4 came out in the summer of 1997 it was the last mortal kombat game to be in arcades most of the principle characters return liu kang raiden johnny cage reptile sub zero scorpion goro returns which kind of pi s   s   es me off 1 he 's harder than he was in mk 1 or mk trilogy 2 he was n't even in mk 4 you fought quan chi as the sub boss jax sony are back   some of the newer characters i did n't care for like reiko he was a poor substitute for noob saibot but noob is a secret character he has no ending though goro is another secret character he has no ending so it 's pretty pointless i hate kai jarek is just another poor substitute for kano ilike fujin quan chi tanya is alright shinnok is cool to play as story is shinnok escaped the neterreln thousands thousands of years ago shinnok was an elder god he betrayed them he needs this powerful amulant raiden shinnok fought over it ended with millions of people dying shinnok was banished to the neterreln while the invasion of earthrelm was going on noob saibot helped quan ch get shinnok out of the neterreln shinnok overtaken edina takes kitana hostage kitana is liu kang 's love of his life all around good time girl so liu kang helps raiden shinnok has killed most of the elder gods except for a wind god fujin quan chi scorpion have a history he tells scorpion yes that sub zero is lying about being a brother that he ready killed his clan his family also tanya a new fighter reptile join to help shinnok tanya 's job is trap liu kang have him killed if you 're seen her ending she does it 's not official liu kang lives on until mk v. shinnok agrees to send him back in time to his original race if he helps him reptile is lied to again since shinnok is a fallen elder god the battle can be won by motals jax sonya are hunting down a black dragon guy named jarek if you have beat this game as jax it 's a really bad a   s   s ending the fmv endings look better on the ps1 it 's not perfect the main boss shinnok i quan chi should 've been the boss instead he 's in most of the endings   nothing wrong with shinnok i 'll say this he 's better than the dragon king or blaxe cause they were straight forward run of the mill monsters but when you compare him to shang tsung or shao kahn he does n't measure up the game has a lot of in your face gore this game got ported to the playstation nintendo 64 an expanded version called motal kombat gold on the sega dreamcast the 64 version has the advantage that it 's a cartridge no load time but the 64 controller is n't made for fighting games the playstation version has better picture quality for the endings you can get an arcade stick for it i 've never played or have dreamcast but i 've heard mk gold is glitchy but kung lao baraka kitana are added i think it has millena cyrax i do n't know if mame will run it this woulalso be the last game of   the boon tobias era next is going to be an all time gulity pleasure motal kombat anhillation
this game is a few years old of course but i was so pleased with it that i played it all last night after it was shipped to me definitely the best fighting game for the fading n64 platform it is somewhat easy on the easy settings almost too easy mind you and as you increase the challenge level the computer opponents increase in ability almost 10 fold the only gripe that i have is that some moves are just not condusive to being made on the n64 controller my hands also wanted to keep sliding over into the traditional n64 grip on the controller with the stick and not the pad but this game does not play well with the stick and thus you have to use the pad that will feel weird at first you can re map the buttons to better suite your needs but if you do other moves will be more difficult to pull off as well for instance sub zero 's famous slide is almost impossible to do without taking your right hand off the controller and repositioning it on the correct buttons to make him do his slide while you 're doing this you 're getting your butt kicked because how are you going to concentrate on where the buttons are during the fight?i still give it 5 stars because those problems are not really that significant in the long run the combo system is wonderful and anyone who is looking for a good fighting game on the n64 console should pick this one up with the price that it is at now it is very affordable too i highly recommend it
this is a little superior to its playstation version the graphics are better the controls are a little better and it 's a litle more fun this is a great game and i think this should please all mortal kombat fans if you still have your nintendo 64 and you don't have this game get it now
i had this game given to me for free years ago on the pc format i liked it but for some reason it crashed on me one day and i must ve done something to the disc 'cause it never worked or would reinstall on any computer after that all these years later i 've just picked it up second hand for the n64 and i must say there is not really any difference between the pc version and the 64 version which is a good thing!the only difference is in the movies the pc and i spose gaystation version had the movies ending in video form where as the 64 replicates them the same way using the polygons of the 3d characters themselves i have no complaint about it i like it wether it 's video form or 3d poly form they both still tell the same story except reiko who just walks off into a portal .. the other versions show what happens when he goes into the portal he puts on his shoa kahn mask shame that s not in it all the codes and moves where the same and i like the fact that the practive mode allows you to press pause and choose a list that displays all the characters moves fatalitys and weapens etc ... tho i 'm really kind of sick of the combinations of move lifts which makes it great to just go into the options highlight continues and hold down block+run untill it takes you to the hidden menu where you can turn on auto fatalitys and stuff the only bad thing i can say about the game is what it should have had included it needed to be fixed so that the auto fatalitys worked like in mk trilogy all platforms except the n64 version where each button freformed a diffrent fatality 2 fats freindship babality etc .. that about it this game is one of the best head to head fighter games unfortunatly the team at crapcom decided to make a billion versions of street fighter for every other system ... talk about over kill ... but they did nt wanna make one for the 64 so that s there loss which means mortal kombat is the best head to head fighter on the 64 if you ask me this game is actualy converted to the 64 straight from the arcade and then extras where added in after that which makes it better then the arcade like the fact you can play as goro noobsaibot and a skinless character named meat go to gamefaq com for the codes)mk is the best head to head fighter on the n64 in this realm
mk4 is a superior fighting game my mouth is watering for mortal kombat deadly alliance in mk4 there are the classic fighters scorpion subzero reptile sonya liu kang jax plus some fighters that were introduced in the flawed subzero mytholiogies quan chi shinnock plus new for mk4 tanya fugin kia recko jarek there 's a total of 15 fighters with 2 hidden fighters 17 all together this game moves very fast if you know how to play it but until then your fighter may look a little silly jumping around while your getting the hang of things personally i like the mortal kombat kombo system and over all formula better than any other fighting game favorite fighters r quan chi reptile subzero liu kang least favorites r ... oh i like'm all wanna cheat menu for easy fatalities try this go to options highlight continues hold block run at the same time for about 5 seconds you will hear outstanding continue to hold the buttons for 3 more seconds a menu will appear now when it says finish him you may perform a fatality by holding down pressing the b button
the first time i played this game i was in the mall and it was cool so i decided to get it when it came out it 's a lot more different looking than mk trilogy it looks more realistic also the title says it all .....
mortal kombat is a totally cool fighting game series digitized and bloody fighting combined with neck breaking spine ripping fatality moves make the series seem like gold but i personally find the transition from 2d to 3d for this series scary at first glance i originally thought the fatalities would end up being like horror movie scenes however i ended up sticking with it in arcade mode there were about 5 or 6 difficulty modes in mortal kombat on the snes i played well on it in mortal kombat 2 on game boy i was able to tackle hard mode in mortal kombat 4 for game boy i can beat master mode but that version of this game was too easy here i got my butt kicked even on normal mode the game is pretty challenging but i think if a player 's good enough he can whop through easily the gameplay is traditional mortal kombat fighting action there are also some new moves such as twisting someone 's leg the graphics are also really great especially considering some of the nintendo 64 's limits such as the 2d blood during the game over screen and of course the sound is top notch there are very few fighting games for the nintendo 64 and this is your saving grace for your virtual strength
though officially the 4th installment in the mk series mortal kombat 4 followed one upgrade game a compilation game and a sub zero spinoff game making it around the 7th actual produced game for the series it was the first game to utilize a 3-d engine and the first mk game to feature weapons combat while the 3-d engine was a refreshing change of pace after the stale sprite based animation of the previous entries in truth mk4 gets dull rather quickly without the 3-d engine it 's pretty much the same as previous installments only with less characters and less finishing moves the idea to finally drop the silly finishers like friendships and babalities was a good one but once you go through all the finishers and stage fatalities you 've pretty much seen it all the basic fight engine is solid but feels a little too simplistic and generic the pre programmed combos were toned down which should be a good thing but after awhile you miss the wow factor that came with delivering them the sidestepping button does n't really do enough to change things and weapons are so easily lost that its not worth pulling them out except for the coolness factor mk4 's still decent and worth buying if you find a used cartridge around but only because the n64 seriously lacked solid fighting games the playstation had plenty of 2-d and 3-d fighters that made mk4 pale in comparison it 's still fun to go a few rounds with friends and its a nice pre cursor to the more advanced deadly alliance and deception but the game just does nt leave you satisfied
you just drive tanks around and blow stuff up.its just like that.the objectives are very decieving.itll say like just go over across the bridge.but the bridge is across town and on every corner is a team of tanks armed with lasers nukes mines and all kind of nasty stuff.me and the ol lady beat it in one afternoooooooooooooooooooon.so what to do then?well there s a really great deathmatch section.go there and play your friends.the computer is a bit more powerful than on the regular game.by a bit i mean hell kick the crap right out of you.so be careful.whats also fun is to go into a big city on death match like san fran sisco with a buddy and kill all the computer players as a team.then just go around and level the whole city brick by brick.one very cool thing is the nuke.you set it off and well ....... youve heard all about it in school.try it out.its awesome
sup dawg let 's be serious here i am not in any way the god who made nintendo i am however the god of battletanx from exploding nukes to mini howitzers to the flash being incarnated into a tank this game has it all call of duty ai n't got a thing on this beauty you can kidnap queens you can dominate the world map you can even stand around like a pacifist and let yourself die this game has what you want this game has what you need you must obtain battletanx
i picked this up the other day it only took a few hours to finish the 1-player mode but i suppose the fact that i 'd previously played battletanx global assault on ps1 helped me out a little story some virus gets out of control and eliminates 99.9 of the females on planet earth this dude named griffin is in love with this girl and then the government comes and takes her away meanwhile gangster militias that are armed with tanks take over the us and likely the rest of the world griffin vows to get his girlfriend back and save america from the various tank gangs gameplay you play the entire campaign through in your stereotypical mock abrams tank blasting through enemy defenses and rescuing or kidnapping women your tribal army needs women to stay in existence different gangs have different types of tanks there are a variety of powerups for your tank like swarmer missiles guided missiles lasers and gun buddies you can set down to defend areas most of the missions remind me of a multiplayer session of capture the flag from any number of fps games battletanx 's single player is unique in that regard controls they work pretty good no complaints multiplayer there 's no co op campaign boo :p you can play through various types of matches most of which resemble the single player levels against friends or the ai you can use the tanks of enemy games in the multi player that 's all good and well i guess but i know i can blow my friends to kingdom come what i really wanted was to be able to play it through the campaign on 2 players graphics they 're early n64 but they look alright i do n't like the fact that your main tank in single player looks so cartoony the comic style storytelling is unique and i think they 're way better than ps1 global assault 's campy voice acting if you 're a fan of the battletanx series i suppose owning what i assume is the first entry is important however if i had to choose between this game and its sequel i would choose the latter due to its better single player campaign
i used to play this game with my dad all the time when i was younger i actually ordered it recently to play with him again when my nintendo 64 stopped working ha
the main game is ok but the multiplay game is hella fun grab a friend or two and play all night i never get tired of battletanx
buy it play battlelord mode with four teams preferably on the las vegas map that 's about all you 'd do anyway do n't bother with the singleplayer it 's garbage i did n't bother finishing it i played the first five or six levels i 'd guess and it was so easy and the story was so retarded that i just did n't care anymore the multiplayer is where it 's at totally intense you play as different factions each one with a slightly different tank set(there are only three kinds of tank -- goliath the generic kind and a super fast little one w/ only machine guns the tankset just determines how many of each you 'll get ... some are only goliaths or the little ones and things like that each faction also has a special starting weapon guided missiles(which are very good against base defenses since you do n't have to go in there and get pelted cloaking shields swarm missiles etc so yeah the multiplayer is simply amazing and the game is definitely cheap enough by now that if you see it you should buy it without question do n't worry about the graphics you wo n't notice when you 're dodging guided missiles goliath tanks and mines trying to get the queenlord back to your base so you can win the round also if you do get it you might consider setting the control setup to driver because the default control setup is kinda deplorable
this game is great you can either duel it out with up to 3 of you 're freinds(plus you or do a single player campaign let me explain single player campaign first a deadly virus kills 99 of women in the game and so the national guard takes the reamaining women to a quarantine zone in the game you are griffin spade and you must rescue madison from the federal relocation forces(earlier reffered to as the national guard to progress in the game you must destroy enemy tanks and bunkers destroy enemy bases prior to rescueing the queenlords inside them(the last base is the quarantine zone in snfrinsisco),take the queenlords to you 're base via you 're tank earn new types of tanks as you progress(goliath m1a1,and a minature one),gain ally tanks by earning points(note you ca n't get ally tanks until after rescueing the first qeenlord),and gain power ups which provide you 're tank with sheilds replacement armor(if you 're tank gets damaged),weapons and ammo the capaign mode is really fun and has good replay value(considering you can get more tanks if you get more points than you did lst time),but it 's still good to do multiplayer modes with freinds for both practice(to prepair for campaign mode and fresh challenges(if you 've beat campaign mode more than once plus campaign mode includes bonus rounds where you can earn extra points okay here 's a list of all the multiplayer modes deathmatch you must be on you 're own against other players for this one but you can get automatick gun terrets to assist you annilation depending on the gang you choose you get a certain number of goliaths minature tanks(similar in size to gun terrets and of course m1a1 's   battlord simply steal enemy queenlords   strategy is greatly involved as they 're are 3 ways to get past a enemy goliath tank(fire guided missiles from your own base move in and out fast with a moto tank head on attack lay mines on its track or place a neough gun buddies to take it down   defense measures include protecting your goliath tank laying mine around your base switching to goliath tank or placing gun buddies
i 'm not a fan of fps 's by far they 're one of my least favorite genres but this game is just excellent one of the best licensed games i 've had the joy of seeing unless you own a controller pak you ca n't save the game and the controls can be hard to understand at first but it 's an excellent game
omg seen it wiped my eyes to see if it was real then of course bought and i have no regrets highly love south park and this game is amazing and it came to me mint condition and i was happy
this game is n't very exciting i do n't like this game it 's boring .what you do in this game is try to go through boring levels that do n't look very detailed i warn you you wo n't like this game i warn you don't pick this up this game is really old   and just such a bad game
south park the video game is all right i do n't think it 's smash worthy but i really do n't think it 's flush worthy either because it did probably one of the smarter things and totally copied 007 goldeneye and gave it a total south park twist as usual weird stuff is happening around south park like mad killer turkeys are attacking the city strange mutants are running around and crazy self propelled toys are out to get you as you take the baddest 8 year olds on the planet stan kyle kenny and cartman on this strange vulger and very gratuitous journey i got ta say it the game was funny and it made me laugh all the way through especially if you ran across the terrance and phillip bombs other than that i really did n't feel there was much else besides all the cool codes like all the weapons codes and stuff and that you could be so many people in the multiplayer mode like officer barbrady mr. mackey m'kay terrance and phillip and if you really wanted to starvin marvin the story is really silly but then again when is there an episode of south park that is n't just plain out ridiculous exactly the controls are pretty easy too you can set it to goldeneye style of control or for you advanced users you can use a turok type of control i still got ta say that i would n't play it for it 's story mode personally i 'd play it for it 's multiplayer mode because that 's what the game is really good at that and i personally thought you could do a lot more in the vs modes rather than in the story modes for you parents most of the swearing is bleeped out but a few quot;choice&quot phrases are in there so give it a thought before you buy it for your kids for those of you that do n't have to worry about that order a pizza call over a few friends and throw on some south park multiplayer have fun
i used to play this game years ago lol the funniest foul mouthed 3rd graders stick it to the turkeys once and for all from dart guns- pee drenched snow balls this game is a good laugh for south park fans
this is truly a funny game it captures the feel of south park with it 's cartoony style the weapons are funny like snowballs 2nd fire- yellow snowballs to plungers the voices from the show are funny i recomend this game to any south park fan out there
this game if so funny pee snowballs annoying turkeys and it is in south park colorado what more could you ask for the controls are hard at first but in 10 20 minutes it becomes easy the game is really fun and looks great on the 64
super funny game a little raunchy but hilarious all the while may not be appropriate for younger kids the story is fun to play yet predictable
this game was very poorly made ... it 's really boring because all you do is walk around and throw stuff at things all the enemies are exactly the same there 's never any health and 100 health points are n't enough because the health goes down too fast the sight of range is ridiculous because half the screen is nothing but fog and it all just draws in as you walk ahead making it hard to see enemies i do like seeing the familiar south park characters in 3d the game is very funny and the weapons are hilarious but still i would n't buy it rent at most
i only gave this game 2 stars because if you 're die hard south park fan it 's possible that you might enjoy this game ... but i like south park and i hated it the controls are impossible to use you have to use the c buttons most of the time the gameplay is repetitive and boring all you do is walk around throwing snowballs at turkeys and the multiplayer part is boring too one pro is that the guns are pretty original amp the south park kids say some funny things but the novelty wears off after a while i bought this game when it first came out for ... and i sold it for 5 at a stoop sale ... i just wanted to get rid of it it 's really that bad if you really have to get it at least rent it first
sure this game 's been out for alomost four years now but it 's time i reviewed it the exceptionally popular foul mouth tv shows based on the fictional yet epic adventures of kyle cartman stan and the now removed kenny four innocent little third graders now fourth in the snowy mountain town of colorado it 's a wonderful life you have a gay teacher a pimp daddy chef a best friend who dies more than 10 times a week and all the cheesy poofs you could ever want at least until killer turkeys aliens clones and toys invade your town and try to take it over you and you alon must prevent these attacks or you could just leave the worthless town to be burnt but then the game 's no fun).like all shooter 's i only enjoy this game with cheats the master cheat for this game is bobbybird or if you break it down bobby bird it unlocks every weapon level and everything else your twisted little mind wants from this game in single player you assume the role of either stan cartman kenny or who i always pick kyle each comes with their own insults and comments as you progress you find kenny cartman and stan and they come with you but you ca n't play as or with them they just allow you to hold more weapons and item i guess that 's because it 's four pairs of hands your first mission is to destroy the turkeys and ultimatly the gigantic robo turkey without cheats you start with a snowball or you can advance it and make it a yellow snowball and if you 've seen jackass you know what that is the other weapons are a cow launcher a toy machine gun and more sooooo much more this game is a good game but only if you 're a fan of the tv show even though it would be fun if some people were n't they 'd still annoy everyone complaining of bad language and foul humor ignore them if you 're a fan get this or at least rent it later
this n64 title was exclusive for n64 at one point but that does n't really matter   south park 64 looked really promising at first and it truly was with it 's shocking yet really great graphics some what game play   and i was looking forward to one of the things south park is best at   stupid funny plot   it kina had one but ends up failing and i love south park it 's one of the best shows out there   but for a game it 's just .. average   nothing new just run and gun but i liked the whole senario stories like the visitors and the turkey episodes   those were great   the game starts off really well as you battle your way through vicious turkeys but once you beat the turkey boss it just drags on with the same ol run n gun and then fight the boss with nothing new   it 's just the same ol' same ol graphics are really good and one of the best on the n64   it really shows what the n64 can do   one of the best parts are the bosses cause there 3d animation is sooooo good   but that is just it ... graphics ... now lets get to the problemgameplay gets really boring after awhile   really ... it 's just the same ol same ol but the game is great for die hard southpark fans   i thought the game could have bin better but hey it was n't but they still try to do a good job   but still ... gameplay is just a lil boring .. sound is perfect ... trey parker and matt stone do a great job as teh voices of those crazy boys   sound is great ok!prosgraphicssoundvoicesconsgameplay is just way to boring and a bit tediousseems like playing the first episode over againthe ending is sooo crappy i was really expecting something big and cool but just same lame ending ... then again it 's just a game based on a show but seriously over all i give it .... a3.2 out of 5 starsget this game at your own risk but i recomend chef 's luv shack ... much much betta and fun mini games lates
i love south park i remember walking around in middle school back in the 1990 's with the south park shirts on and everyone talking about the new episode times have changed but i still love south park
now being a big fan of the hit tv show i was a little skeptical at first if the game would bring down the integrity of the show but in the end it did not south park is n't a great game but if you love the show you will definitely enjoy it you can chose between the four main characters kyle cartman stan and kenny usually i pick cartman because he is the funniest one out of the group and has the best insults they implemented the same humor they use in their tv show so the sound samples keep you the most entertained the point of the game is to save your town from evil turkeys aliens toys clones and what not each level gets kind of repetitive so the game can be a little boring there is not much variety to it but let me reiterate that the voice samples do and will keep you entertained i give this game credit for the humor sound creativity and graphics but it lacks in level design and keeping the gamer entertained through other means rather than sound overall i rate this game a 3 out of 5 because although its cleaver and funny the actual game play of the game is not that exciting if i wanted humor then i could just turn on the show
now if you are a fan or those 2-d games and stuff like that you probably will think this is a disgrace for the n64 i thought this game was awesome especially the beginning forest of silence the music and sound effects are great and the game story is good the controls may take a while to get used to but if you like games with a challenge get this i think that fighting skeletons gets boring after a while but i think when you get to higher levels i 'm not sure of this there will be more vicious enemies to fight for your pleasure i thought the game could have been a little more ... well .... diverse and detailed but where i am now is awesome i have to say i bought this at fucoland and i had no idea i would like it this much i rented it once before and i hated it because it was so hard really i just did n't put my mind to it and look where i am now i 'm in the 1st castle this is a great action rpg game that will keep you hooked for hours i would recommend that 10 and up should play this game because of the theme and the bloody scenes there is n't much of a story to this game but for me that 's okay but for serious gamers i think i am but this game is so good that i do n't really care about the story you might be a little ticked off because of the lack of story there many levels for you to get through and they all take a long time the forest of silence took me about 3 hours to figure everything out no cheats no guide no nothing there are two charaters to chose from reinhart and a girl i forgot her name now reinhart has a sword and a whip to fight off enemies and to destroy other things i think he is better than the girl because he has a stronger weapon the girl has a energy ball that takes 2 seconds to charge up i do n't like that because if an enemy is comming towards you you have to charge she also has these two .... rings they look like she uses that to slice things just like reinhart 's sword there are two modes you can go through easy and normal normal is not that hard but there is quite a difference between that and easy there are some options that you can do like the controls and stuff as i mentioned before their is n't much of a storyline but when you start the game there is some so that makes the game better be prepared to do a lot of jumping overall this game has great sound effects music weapons items charaters abilities an okay storyline excellent graphics and just a really good play
konami took a bold step into 3-d with this castlevania installment for the 64   unfortunately it did n't live up to expectations which part of it is because it was n't the same people believe it or not that did symphony of the night psx   read on to see why it 's a below average game the goodfinally castlevania in 3-d   despite many shortcomings the game does have some eerie music and a dark atmosphere which are characteristic of a castlevania game at least the newer releases   you can select between two characters carrie and reinhart that change the storyline somewhat the badi was never a fan of the 64 controller and this is the one game where it hurt most   the controls and gameplay were difficult at best and normally i have a decent tolerance level for controls here 's where i absolutely loathed it   getting your character to go where you want is quite a challenge for this game   also the storyline aside from the two characters different yet similar paths is really hollow at its core and does n't add anything new to the castlevania legacy overallnot recommended   i advise renting the game only   only buy it if you are a die hard n64 fan   otherwise i strongly recommend skipping it   i 'm a big castlevania fan and i feel that this game does not do the series justice   i noticed some people in their reviews that they liked this game over bloodlines genesis why   bloodlines had far better gameplay and replay value than this   perhaps it 's because 90 of gamers today prefer graphics over gameplay when it 's gameplay that creates the game
castlevania 64 offers you the experience of seeing a castlevania adventure in a free roaming 3-d realm i have played every castlevania game right back to the nes days and this is a good addition to a fine series this is a great game but not as good as castlevania symphony of the night for playstation to start on a positive note there is a lot of depth added thanks to the 3-d graphics you can roam freely battle monsters face to face and search for hidden items without the constraints of side scrolling the control is responsive and the buttons are easy to figure out which is good considering the pace of the game the 3-d worlds are huge and are fun to explore the sound is also excellent you can hear the clatter of bones the snapping of jaws and the cracking of whips clearly without that horrible distortion that we all remeber from earlier installments the cons of this game are mostly technical nothing to do with the graphics or storyline first of all the camera can be a servere pain sometimes it often lingers when you do n't want it to and the response time for panning and scanning is pertty bad the control is good but sometimes it is clunky when you need to perform delicate movements i remember the first level when i kept falling into the water and dying when i tried to jump from one ledge to another and missed by one inch also a map would be helpful certain areas look the same as others and sometimes i can not tell where i have been and where i am going but as i said these are more technical flaws they do n't exactly ruin the game overall this game is fun and gives a whole new depth to the long running series but as good as this is castlevania sotn for playstation is much better
i was really eager to see this installment in the castlevania series mainly because of it 's venture into 3-d. well i can honestly say i was pleasantly surprised they were able to pull off a pretty decent game and that in itself makes it another great effort from konami it really reminded me alot of the older castlevania games yet in 3-d. despite others mixed feelings on the game i really enjoyed it my only gripe however is that it was hard and frustrating at times with its platform areas in levels once i made it pass those parts it was great one in my opinion that was worthy of my hard earned dollar although i love the 2-d castlevania games a great deal i do hope they make another game like this one in the future
this game still creeps me out it 's really fun to have those memories come flooding back as i whip my way through skeletons
